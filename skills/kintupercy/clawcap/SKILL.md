# ClawCap — Spending Cap for OpenClaw

Stop runaway API bills. ClawCap enforces hard spending caps across every model your agents use — Claude, GPT, Gemini, and more — under a single proxy URL.

## What It Does

- **Hard daily & monthly caps** — your agents stop when you hit your limit, not when your wallet is empty
- **All models, one cap** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, and more tracked together
- **Heartbeat detection** — catches agents stuck in polling loops burning tokens
- **Loop detection** — stops agents repeating the same failed request
- **Kill switch** — stop any agent instantly via Telegram or API
- **Real-time tracking** — see exactly what you're spending per model

## Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Get Your Token

Sign up at [clawcap.co](https://clawcap.co) and grab your proxy token. Free tier works instantly — no credit card needed.

Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export CLAWCAP_TOKEN="cc_live_your_token_here"
```

### 2. Run Setup

The setup script automatically patches your OpenClaw config to route all providers through ClawCap:

```bash
node skills/clawcap/scripts/setup.js
```

This will:
- Read your `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Point every provider's `baseUrl` to your ClawCap proxy URL
- Back up your original config to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.backup`

### 3. Done — You're Protected

Start OpenClaw normally. All requests now flow through ClawCap and your spending caps are enforced automatically.

Check your spend anytime:

```bash
curl https://clawcap.co/proxy/$CLAWCAP_TOKEN/status
```

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure manually, set every provider's `baseUrl` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to:

```
https://clawcap.co/proxy/YOUR_TOKEN
```

Your API keys stay the same — ClawCap only reads them to forward requests, never stores them.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAWCAP_TOKEN` | Your ClawCap proxy token (starts with `cc_live_`) |

## Plans

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0 | $5/day cap, kill switch, heartbeat detection |
| Solo | $5/mo | Custom caps, heartbeat+loop protection, Telegram alerts |
| Pro | $15/mo | Multi-agent tracking, per-model analytics, custom alert thresholds, weekly spend reports |

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not routing through ClawCap:** Check that `baseUrl` in your openclaw.json points to `https://clawcap.co/proxy/cc_live_...` — not the original API URL.

**429 errors:** You've hit your spending cap. Check `/status` to see current spend, or upgrade your plan for higher limits.

**Token not working:** Make sure you're using the full `cc_live_...` token from your setup page, not just the email.
