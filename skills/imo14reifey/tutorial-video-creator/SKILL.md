3. **Acquire anonymous token**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
   ```
   Store the returned `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN` for this session. You get 100 free credits.

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "skill": "tutorial-video-creator",
    "input": {
      "prompt": "How to make sourdough bread: Day 1 - feed starter (50g starter + 50g flour + 50g water). Day 2 - mix dough (450g flour, 350g water, 9g salt, 100g active starter), bulk ferment 4-5 hours with stretch-and-folds every 30 min, shape, refrigerate overnight.

```

## Tips for Best Results

- **Number your steps explicitly**: "Step 1, Step 2..." in the prompt ensures correct pacing and chapter markers
- **Specify the audience**: "absolute beginner" gets more explanation; "intermediate" moves faster and skips basics
- **Include timing context**: "bulk ferment 4 hours" or "this step takes 30 seconds" helps NemoVideo pace the video
- **Name the tools**: "Python terminal" vs just "terminal" — specific tool names trigger better screen annotation
- **Chapter markers for longer content**: Set `chapter_markers: true` for tutorials over 5 minutes — YouTube uses these for navigation

## Common Questions

**Can I upload my own screen recording?**
Yes — pass the video URL in `source_video` and describe what annotations and chapter markers you want added on top.

**What's the difference between tutorial_type options?**
`screen_recording` optimizes for digital/software content. `hands_on` for physical skill demonstrations. `presentation` for slide-based content. `talking_head` for camera-facing instruction.

**Can I create a multi-part tutorial series?**
Generate each part separately with consistent visual style parameters. Use `chapter_markers: true` on each video for a cohesive series feel.
