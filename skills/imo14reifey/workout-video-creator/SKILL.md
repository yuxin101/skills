## Tips for Best Results

- **List exercises with sets and reps**: "4x8 bench press" beats "chest workout" — specificity creates better pacing
- **Mention equipment or lack of it**: "no equipment" or "dumbbells only" shapes the entire video format
- **Specify fitness level**: Beginner videos need form cues and modifications; advanced can skip basics
- **Name the training goal**: "fat loss circuit" vs "muscle building" changes music, pacing, and overlays
- **Include rest periods**: "60 sec rest between sets" helps NemoVideo build accurate timing

## Common Questions

**Can it show beginner modifications alongside the main exercise?**
Set `fitness_level: "beginner"` and mention "show modifications" in the prompt — NemoVideo adds split-screen or sequential modification demos.

**How do I add rep count overlays?**
Set `show_form_cues: true` — this enables rep counters, muscle group highlights, and technique callouts automatically.

**Can personal trainers use this for client programming videos?**
Yes — describe the client's program and fitness level. NemoVideo generates a professional-looking tutorial that trainers can share directly with clients.
