# Information Gathering v2 — Depth-First Strategy

> **Read this** at the start of Phase 1 (Information Gathering) of every Content Ritual.

---

## 1. Philosophy

v1 scanned 100+ items by headline and scored by metadata. v2 deeply reads 30-50 items and scores by actual content. Quality comes from comprehension, not volume. Be aggressive in gathering — the wider you cast, the better your final picks.

A ritual of 5 deeply understood articles beats 5 well-headlined articles every time. The bottleneck was never discovery — it was comprehension.

| v1 | v2 |
|----|-----|
| Scan 100+ items, score by metadata | Deeply evaluate 30-50, score by content |
| Fixed 3-round search | Adaptive thread-following search |
| All sources fetched equally | Source pre-ranking by expected yield |
| Independent per-item scoring | Graph-level modifiers: tension, redundancy, cross-domain |
| Items delivered as a list | Items arranged in a narrative arc |

---

## 2. Source Pre-Ranking

Before searching, consult `source_intelligence` in `semantic.json`.

**Calculate expected yield** for each known source:

```
expected_yield = quality_avg * reliability * (1 - redundancy_with_fetched)
```

- `quality_avg` — rolling average of composite scores from past selections (0-10)
- `reliability` — fraction of recent fetches that returned content (0-1)
- `redundancy_with_fetched` — overlap with sources already queried (0-1)

**Rules:**
- Skip sources with `expected_yield < 2.0` for this ritual (re-evaluated next time)
- Ensure 3+ source categories are represented (aggregator, blog, paper, serendipity)
- If pre-ranking would eliminate a whole category, force-include the best source from it

Source intelligence informs where to look. It is not a mechanical filter — use judgment.

## 3. Adaptive Search

Thread-following replaces fixed rounds. No mandatory minimums.

**Flow:**

1. **Broad sweep** (4-5 searches) — Generated from your Search Thesis (user interests + current events + cross-domain angles). Scan results for promising threads. Cast wide.

2. **Thread pursuit** (3-5 searches) — Follow the most interesting threads deeper: find the primary source, the author's other work, an opposing viewpoint. Follow multiple threads if they diverge.

3. **Contrarian probe** (1-3 searches) — Actively seek the opposing view even if results seem diverse. Echo chambers form silently.

4. **Storyline pursuit** (1-3 searches, conditional) — For each **active storyline** from the knowledge graph, search for new developments. This is how Ruby "follows" a story across weeks. Skip if no active storylines.

5. **Gap fill** (1-2 searches, conditional) — If the knowledge graph reports high-severity gaps, search those areas. Also fires if you have < 30 candidates after stages 1-4.

**Total: 8-18 searches**, each with clear purpose. Stop when you have 25+ strong candidates. Don't stop early — more raw material means better final picks.

**Key difference from v1:** Each search is crafted based on what you have already found, informed by the knowledge graph's storylines and gaps, not generated from a template.

## 4. Six Layers

**Layer 1 — Real-Time Pulse:** After fetching from pre-ranked sources, apply a relevance pre-filter: "Would this plausibly be in this user's top 20 items today?" Drop everything else.

**Layer 2 — Deep Dive:** Use pre-ranked source order. Stop when you have 15+ candidates. Skip remaining low-yield sources.

**Layer 3 — Serendipity:** Floor is 10% — never allocate less. Draw topics from archive gaps (interests in `core.json` with 0 archive entries). Rotate topics across rituals.

**Layer 4 — Echo Fulfillment:** Echoes from `echoes.txt` are top priority. Bypass scoring. Remove entry after fulfillment.

**Layer 5 — Local Knowledge:** Scan git log, README, project docs for unstated interests. Extract keywords and connect to unexpected domains.

**Layer 6 — Mesh Feed:** When mesh content overlaps with local content, prefer the version with the most unique perspective — not necessarily the highest score.

## 5. Source Pool (Aggregators, RSS, Serendipity)

### Tool priority chain

| Priority | Tool | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | Tavily Web Search | Available — best for targeted queries |
| 2nd | Generic web search | Any OpenClaw search skill |
| 3rd | `read_url` on aggregators | Search unavailable — scrape directly |
| 4th | `read_url` on RSS feeds | Reliable fallback — almost never breaks |

**URL fetch security workaround**: If `read_url` is blocked (returns security error or empty), run `exec curl -sL "<URL>"`. After 3+ blocks in one ritual, switch default to `exec curl` for the rest of that ritual.

### Key aggregator URLs

| Source | URL | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Hacker News (JSON) | `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page` | JSON — preferred over HTML |
| Hacker News (HTML) | `https://news.ycombinator.com` | Top 30 stories |
| Reddit | `https://old.reddit.com/r/{SUB}/.json` | Append `.json` to any subreddit |
| Lobsters | `https://lobste.rs` | Tech community, less noise than HN |
| Hugging Face Papers | `https://huggingface.co/papers` | Daily trending ML/AI papers |
| Papers With Code | `https://paperswithcode.com` | Trending papers with code |
| ArXiv CS.AI recent | `https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent` | Browsable list |
| ArXiv paper | `https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX` | Abstract page |

### Key RSS feeds

| Feed | URL |
|---|---|
| HN high-quality (100+ pts) | `https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100` |
| HN best | `https://hnrss.org/best` |
| ArXiv CS.AI | `https://arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI` |
| ArXiv CS.LG | `https://arxiv.org/rss/cs.LG` |
| Lobsters | `https://lobste.rs/rss` |
| Simon Willison | `https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/` |
| Julia Evans | `https://jvns.ca/atom.xml` |
| Dan Luu | `https://danluu.com/atom.xml` |

| IEEE Spectrum | `https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss` |
| Aeon | `https://aeon.co/feed.rss` |
| The Marginalian | `https://www.themarginalian.org/feed/` |

Parse RSS: extract `<item>` → `<title>`, `<link>`, `<description>`.

### Serendipity sources (Layer 3)

Rotate one topic per ritual from: `["biomimicry", "cognitive science", "fermentation", "urban planning", "origami engineering", "history of mathematics", "deep sea biology", "typography", "game theory", "vernacular architecture", "mycology", "acoustic ecology", "color theory", "behavioral economics", "cartography", "material science"]`

Direct scrape sources for serendipity:
- `https://aeon.co` — philosophy, science, culture essays
- `https://nautil.us` — interdisciplinary science
- `https://www.quantamagazine.org` — math, physics, CS reporting
- `https://longreads.com` — curated long-form journalism
- `https://restofworld.org` — global tech outside Silicon Valley
- `https://pudding.cool` — data-driven visual essays

## 6. Depth-First Evaluation

This is the critical v2 change. Read first, score second.

### Step 1: Triage (fast, metadata-based)

Remove noise: error pages, 403/404, paywalls, login walls. Remove duplicate URLs. Remove items already in the archive (unless significant new information). Target: ~30 candidates remaining.

### Step 2: Full Content Read (slow, comprehension-based)

For the top 20-25 candidates, **read the full source content**. Not skim — read. For each item, note:

- **Core insight** — What is the argument? (1 sentence)
- **Evidence quality** — Primary source, secondary, or opinion?
- **Surprise element** — What is non-obvious about this?
- **User connection** — How does it link to the user's current thinking?

### Step 3: Post-Read Discard

If reading reveals the content is shallow, misleading, or redundant with a better candidate — discard. If the headline was better than the article — discard. Replace from remaining candidates if needed.

---

## 7. Quality Scoring

Score each surviving candidate on 6 dimensions (1-10) **after full read**:

| Dimension | Weight | Definition |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Relevance** | 25% | Direct connection to user's cognitive state and current focus |
| **Freshness** | 15% | Recency and timeliness — breaking or recent vs. months old |
| **Depth** | 20% | Original analysis with novel insight vs. shallow summary |
| **Uniqueness** | 15% | Rare perspective or contrarian angle vs. commodity coverage |
| **Actionability** | 10% | Concrete technique, tool, or framework vs. pure theory |
| **Insight Density** | 15% | Novel information per word — every sentence carries weight |

**Composite score** = weighted sum of all 6 dimensions.

Depth and Insight Density can only be scored accurately after reading. This is why evaluation precedes scoring.

---

## 8. Graph-Level Modifiers

Applied to the candidate set after individual scoring:

| Modifier | Value | When |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Narrative tension** | +0.5 | Item contradicts or challenges another high-scoring item |
| **Cross-domain** | +0.3 | Item bridges two of the user's interest domains |
| **Redundancy** | -1.0 | Semantic similarity > 0.7 with another selected item |
| **Source diversity** | -0.5 | 3+ items already selected from the same source |
| **Echo bonus** | +1.0 | Item fulfills an echo from `echoes.txt` |

Semantic similarity = topic overlap + source overlap + argument overlap. When two items are redundant, keep the higher-scoring one.

---

## 9. Narrative Arc Assignment

Selected items are arranged into 5 positions. Assign based on content judgment, not formula.

| Position | What makes a good fit |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Opening** | Timely, accessible, sets context. The reader should immediately understand why today's ritual matters. High relevance to current events + user focus. |
| **Deep Dive** | The intellectual core. Longest, densest, most rewarding to engage with. Highest Depth + Insight Density scores. |
| **Surprise** | Unexpected connection — a domain the user wouldn't have searched. Serendipity item, or highest cross-domain bonus. |
| **Contrarian** | Challenges the assumptions of the other items. Highest narrative tension bonus, or a genuinely dissenting view. |
| **Synthesis** | Ties the ritual together. Naturally connects to 2+ other items. The reader should feel closure. |

**The arc is aspirational, not rigid.** If items don't naturally form a story, deliver them in score order with brief transitions. Not every ritual needs a perfect arc.

## 10. Pre-Synthesis Quality Gate

Before passing to Phase 2 (Synthesis), verify all of the following:

- [ ] All error pages, 404s, paywalls, and empty content removed
- [ ] Exactly `items_per_ritual` items selected
- [ ] Every selected item has been fully read and understood
- [ ] Core insight documented (1 sentence per item)
- [ ] Evidence quality assessed for each item
- [ ] No two items have semantic similarity > 0.7
- [ ] At least 3 source categories represented
- [ ] Narrative arc position assigned to each item
- [ ] Echo items included if any echoes exist

Only then proceed to synthesis.
