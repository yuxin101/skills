# youtube-download

Downloads YouTube videos to your ~/Downloads folder using yt-dlp.

## What it does

- Takes a YouTube URL as input
- Downloads the best available quality (video + audio merged to MP4)
- Saves to ~/Downloads with the video title as filename

## Usage

```bash
{baseDir}/youtube-download.sh "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

Or just give me the URL and I'll run it for you.

## Requirements

- yt-dlp must be installed: `brew install yt-dlp`
- On first run, if yt-dlp is missing, the skill will prompt you to install it
