### Title Optimization

**Shopee title formula:**
`[Brand (if applicable)] [Product Type] [Key Feature] [Attribute: Size/Color/Material] [Use Case/Occasion]`

**Title rules:**
- 100-120 characters (use close to max)
- Lead with highest-search keyword
- Include 2-3 key attributes buyers filter by
- Avoid ALL CAPS (poor readability)
- Include local language terms for SEA markets

**Title examples:**
```
Bad:  "Water Bottle"
Good: "Stainless Steel Water Bottle 500ml Insulated Thermos Coffee Tea Hot Cold Gym Sport"

Bad:  "Phone Case iPhone"
Good: "iPhone 15 Pro Max Case Transparent MagSafe Compatible Shockproof Anti-Yellow TPU Cover"
```

**Market-specific title adaptations:**
```
SG/MY: English-first, include product specs precisely
ID:    Bahasa Indonesia terms, include "premium" or "import" for trust
TH:    Thai keywords in description minimum, English OK in title
PH:    English with Filipino lifestyle context
VN:    Vietnamese-friendly terms, quality signals important
TW:    Traditional Chinese preferred, quality and certification focus
```

### Image Requirements and Optimization

- Recommended: 2000×2000 pixels (allows zoom)

**Image sequence strategy:**
```
Image 1: Main product (white background, hero shot)
Image 2: Product from different angle / multiple pieces
Image 3: Lifestyle shot (product in use context)
Image 4: Key feature close-up / infographic
Image 5: Size comparison or dimension callout

### Pricing Strategy for Shopee

**Pricing framework:**
1. Calculate floor price (cost + fees + minimum margin)
2. Research competitor price range on Shopee
3. Set strategic price position:

```
Penetration (new listing): Set at -10% vs. median competitor
Growth (50+ reviews): Set at market median
Premium (100+ reviews, top-rated): Set at +10-20% with strong differentiation

Shopee fees to account for:
Commission: 2-5% (varies by category and seller tier)
Transaction fee: 2%
```

**Flash sale pricing:**
- Platform flash deals require min 20% discount from regular price
- Set regular price accounting for frequent promotions
- Formula: Regular price = Target sell price / (1 - max discount %)

### Variation Setup

**Shopee variation types:**
```
Single variation: Size (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
                  Color (Red, Blue, Black, White)
                  Material (Cotton, Polyester, Silk)

Double variation: Size × Color (Red S, Red M, Blue S, Blue M...)
                  Volume × Flavor (100ml Vanilla, 100ml Chocolate...)
```

**Variation naming conventions:**
- Use clear, customer-facing names (not internal SKU codes)
- Keep consistent naming across all products
- Add "Free Size" or "One Size" for non-varying dimension

### Cross-Market Publishing

When listing in multiple Shopee markets:
```
Base: Create listing in primary market (e.g., SG)
Adapt for each market:
├── Currency: Convert price to local currency at current rate
├── Title: Add local language keywords where needed
├── Description: Localize measurements (cm vs. inches), terminology
├── Shipping: Set correct shipping from your warehouse to each country
└── Compliance: Check category restrictions per country
```

**Price conversion guide:**
```
If SG base price = SGD $25:
MY:  MYR 85   (×3.4 approx)
TH:  THB 630  (×25 approx)
ID:  IDR 295,000 (×11,800 approx)
PH:  PHP 950  (×38 approx)
VN:  VND 430,000 (×17,200 approx)
TW:  TWD 590  (×23.6 approx)
```
