## What Data to Provide

- **Creator username/handle** — TikTok username
- **Creator profile data** — follower count, engagement rate, niche
- **Sample shipment info** — product sent, date shipped, tracking number
- **Content performance** — views, likes, GMV driven per video
- **Commission data** — sales attributed to each creator

## Creator Management Framework

### Creator Tier Classification

**Mega influencers** (1M+ followers):
- Reach: Massive
- Cost: High ($1,000-10,000+ per post)
- ROI: Unpredictable, good for brand awareness
- Sample value: Free + commission (10-15%)
- Best for: Brand launches, viral moments

**Macro influencers** (100K-1M followers):
- Reach: Large
- Cost: $200-2,000 per post
- ROI: Moderate, trackable via affiliate
- Sample value: Free + 15-20% commission
- Best for: Product launches, key market segments

**Mid-tier creators** (10K-100K followers):
- Reach: Meaningful niche audiences
- Cost: $50-500 per post or free samples only
- ROI: Good, highly measurable
- Sample value: Free sample + 20-25% commission
- Best for: Most brands, consistent sales engine

**Micro influencers** (<10K followers):
- Reach: Small but highly engaged
- Cost: Free samples or $0-50
- ROI: Excellent per dollar
- Sample value: Product only (no fee)
- Best for: Product validation, review generation

**Recommendation**: Build 80% of program on mid-tier and micro creators (volume + ROI), 20% on macro for reach.

### Creator Fit Score

Rate each creator 1-5 on 4 dimensions:

1. **Niche alignment** — does their content match your product category?
2. **Audience match** — does their audience match your buyer profile?
3. **Engagement rate** — likes+comments / followers (benchmark: >3%)
4. **Content quality** — production value and authenticity

**Fit score formula:**
```
Total = Niche × 3 + Audience × 3 + Engagement × 2 + Quality × 2
Max score = 50

35+: Strong fit — prioritize outreach
25-34: Good fit — worth pursuing
15-24: Moderate fit — lower priority
<15: Poor fit — skip
```

**Engagement rate benchmarks:**
```
Nano (<10K):    >6% engagement is strong
Micro (10-50K): >4% engagement is strong
Mid (50-500K):  >2.5% engagement is strong
Macro (500K+):  >1.5% engagement is strong
```

### Sample Tracking System

Maintain a sample tracker:
```
Creator | Product | Sent Date | Expected Receive | Status | Follow-up | Content Posted | GMV
@user1  | Prod A  | Jan 5     | Jan 12           | ✓ Rcvd | Done      | Jan 20         | $450
@user2  | Prod B  | Jan 8     | Jan 15           | Shipped| Needed    | —              | $0
@user3  | Prod A  | Jan 10    | Jan 17           | Pending| —         | —              | —
```

**Follow-up timeline:**
- Day 0: Sample shipped, confirm tracking sent to creator
- Day +3: Check tracking, confirm delivered
- Day +5 post-delivery: First follow-up (how did you like it?)
- Day +10 post-delivery: Content reminder if not yet posted
- Day +14 post-delivery: Final follow-up, offer help or extension
- Day +21 post-delivery: Close out (content posted or write off)

### Content Performance Tracking

For each creator's content piece:
```
Creator   | Video Date | Views   | Likes  | Comments | GMV    | Conv%
@creator1 | Jan 20     | 45,000  | 2,300  | 180      | $890   | 2.0%
@creator2 | Jan 22     | 12,000  | 450    | 35       | $120   | 1.0%
@creator3 | Jan 25     | 280,000 | 18,000 | 1,200    | $5,400 | 1.9%
```

**Key performance formulas:**
```
GMV per view = Total GMV / Total views
Cost per sale = Sample cost / Units sold
ROAS = GMV / (Sample cost + any paid fee)
Creator ROI = (GMV - Cost) / Cost × 100
```

### Creator Commission Calculator

```
Example: Creator drives 50 sales at $30 each
Gross GMV:           $1,500
Commission rate:     20%
Creator earned:      $300
Your net:           $1,200
Product COGS (50×$8): $400
Profit from creator: $800

Creator ROI: ($800) / (sample $30 + commission $300) = 2.4x ROAS
```

### Scaling the Creator Program

**Funnel structure:**
```
Top of funnel:     100 creators contacted
↓
Agreed to try:      40 creators (40% acceptance)
↓
Sample sent:        35 creators
↓
Content posted:     20 creators (57% post rate)
↓
Sales generated:    15 creators (75% drive at least some GMV)
↓
Repeat creators:    8 creators (ongoing relationship)
```

**Monthly scaling cadence:**
- Week 1: Recruit 20-30 new creators
- Week 2: Ship samples, confirm receipt
- Week 3: Follow up, collect content
- Week 4: Analyze performance, tier creators for next month
