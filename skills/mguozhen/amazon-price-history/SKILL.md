# Amazon Price History Tracker

Track Amazon product price history, identify pricing patterns, and time your pricing decisions with precision. Alternative to Keepa for sellers who want AI-assisted price analysis.

Paste product data, price snapshots, or competitor pricing. The agent builds price timelines, detects patterns, and recommends optimal pricing windows.

## Commands

```
price add <asin> <price> [date]   # log a price data point
price trend <asin>                # analyze price trend direction
price pattern <asin>              # detect seasonal and cyclical patterns
price alert set <asin> <target>   # set alert for target price threshold
price compare <asin1> <asin2>     # compare pricing histories side-by-side
price best-time <asin>            # identify best time window to raise/lower price
price volatility <asin>           # compute price stability score
price chart <asin>                # render text-based price chart
price report <asin>               # full pricing analysis report
price save                        # save all price history to workspace
```

## What Data to Provide

- **ASIN + price data** — current or historical prices with dates
- **Buy Box price** — the winning price you see on the listing
- **Competitor prices** — other sellers on the same listing
- **Your cost structure** — COGS, FBA fees, target margin
- **Seasonal context** — any known promotions or peak periods

## Price Analysis Framework

### Price Data Points to Track

For each ASIN, capture:
```
Date | Price | Seller | Buy Box? | Coupon | Sale Event | Notes
2024-01-15 | $29.99 | Brand | Yes | 10% off | None | Normal
2024-01-20 | $24.99 | Brand | Yes | None | Flash sale | -17%
2024-02-01 | $32.99 | Brand | Yes | None | None | Post-sale
```

### Price Trend Classification

**Uptrend** (Price rising):
- Average price this month > last month by >5%
- Signal: possible demand increase, supply constraints, or brand repositioning
- Seller action: monitor for opportunity to raise your price

**Downtrend** (Price falling):
- Average price this month < last month by >5%
- Signal: increased competition, excess inventory, or market correction
- Seller action: evaluate your cost floor, avoid race-to-bottom

**Stable** (±5% range):
- Price within 5% of 90-day average
- Signal: mature market equilibrium
- Seller action: compete on other factors (listing quality, reviews, ads)

**Volatile** (Frequent swings >10%):
- Price swings more than 10% within 30 days
- Signal: heavy promotional activity or multiple sellers competing
- Seller action: dynamic repricing is essential

### Price Volatility Score

```
Volatility = (Max Price - Min Price) / Average Price × 100

Score 0-10:   Very stable — predictable market
Score 10-25:  Moderate — some promotional activity
Score 25-50:  Volatile — heavy competition or frequent sales
Score 50+:    Highly volatile — use dynamic repricing or avoid
```

### Seasonal Pattern Detection

Map price history against calendar events:
- **Q4 (Oct-Dec)**: Holiday surge — premium pricing possible
- **Prime Day (July)**: Deep discounts expected, plan inventory
- **Back to School (Aug-Sep)**: Category-specific peaks
- **Valentine's/Mother's Day**: Gift category spikes
- **Post-holiday (Jan-Feb)**: Price depression, clear inventory

### Buy Box Price Analysis

The Buy Box price matters more than list price:
- Track who holds the Buy Box at each snapshot
- Compute your price gap vs. current Buy Box winner
- Identify patterns in Buy Box rotation (if multiple sellers)

**Buy Box pricing rules:**
- New seller entering: typically prices 5-10% below current winner
- FBA advantage: can price slightly higher than FBM and still win
- Low inventory: Buy Box may shift to higher-priced seller

### Price Alert Thresholds

```
PRICE DROP ALERT:   Current price falls >10% below 30-day average
PRICE SPIKE ALERT:  Current price rises >20% above 30-day average
BUY BOX LOST:       Your price is no longer the Buy Box winner
COMPETITOR ENTRY:   New seller appears at significantly lower price
FLOOR ALERT:        Price drops below your calculated margin floor
```

### Optimal Repricing Windows

Based on historical patterns:
- **Best time to raise price**: After a competitor goes out of stock
- **Best time to lower price**: 2 weeks before Prime Day to boost velocity
- **Avoid repricing**: During major sale events (prices stabilize after)
- **Post-holiday**: Expect 15-25% price compression, plan ahead

## Margin Floor Calculation

```
Margin Floor = COGS + FBA Fees + Referral Fee + PPC Cost + Minimum Profit
Example:
  COGS:          $8.00
  FBA fees:      $4.50
  Referral (15%): price × 0.15
  PPC cost:      $2.00
  Min profit:    $2.00
  Floor = $8 + $4.50 + (price × 0.15) + $2 + $2 = solve for price
  Minimum price = ($16.50) / (1 - 0.15) = $19.41
```

## Workspace

Creates `~/price-tracker/` containing:
- `history/` — price logs per ASIN (ASIN.md files)
- `alerts/` — triggered price alerts
- `patterns/` — seasonal pattern analysis
- `reports/` — full pricing reports

## Output Format

Every price analysis outputs:
1. **Price Timeline Table** — chronological price history with key events marked
2. **Trend Direction** — current trend with confidence level
3. **Volatility Score** — 0-100 stability rating with interpretation
4. **Pattern Summary** — detected seasonal or cyclical patterns
5. **Optimal Price Window** — recommended price and timing
6. **Margin Check** — current price vs. your floor, profit per unit
