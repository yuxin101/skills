## What is Intent Security?

Traditional security models ask: *"Do you have permission?"*

Intent security asks: *"Should you do this for this goal?"*

This fundamental shift enables autonomous agents to validate actions against stated objectives, detect goal drift early, and maintain alignment with user intent throughout execution.

                         │  Rollback    │
                         └──────────────┘

## The Problem

Autonomous agents operating without intent validation face several risks:

- **Goal Drift**: Actions gradually diverge from stated objectives
- **Constraint Violations**: Implicit rules are broken unknowingly
- **Unintended Side Effects**: Cascading changes beyond intended scope
- **Context Loss**: Decisions made without understanding broader impact

These issues become critical as agents gain more autonomy and operate in production environments.

---

## The Solution

The Intent Security Agent provides three integrated pillars:

### 1. Intent-Based Security

**Pre-Execution Validation**
- Every action checked against intent specification
- Goal alignment verification
- Constraint satisfaction checks
- Expected behavior matching

**Real-Time Monitoring**
- Anomaly detection during execution
- Resource usage tracking
- Permission boundary enforcement
- Side effect detection

**Automatic Rollback**
- Checkpoint-based state restoration
- Transaction-like guarantees
- Reversible operations
- Recovery without data loss

### 2. Self-Improvement

**Pattern Extraction**
- Learn from successful executions
- Identify antipatterns from failures
- Extract reusable strategies
- Build knowledge base over time

**Strategy Evolution**
- A/B test new approaches
- Compare baseline vs candidate performance
- Adopt improvements automatically
- Track effectiveness metrics

**Bounded Learning**
- Safety guardrails prevent harmful modifications
- Human approval for high-impact changes
- Complexity limits on strategies
- Rollback capability for learning experiments

### 3. Transparency & Oversight

**Complete Audit Trail**
- All decisions logged with rationale
- Action history with timestamps
- Violation records with root cause
- Learning outcomes documented

**Human Approval Gates**
- High-risk actions require permission
- Clear risk assessment presented
- Rollback plan always available
- User maintains final control

**Explainable Learning**
- Traceable improvement paths
- Evidence-based strategy adoption
- Statistical significance testing
- No "black box" decisions

## Key Features

### Intent Validation Flow

```yaml
1. Define Intent
   Goal: "Process customer feedback"
   Constraints: ["read-only", "specific directory"]
   Risk: low

2. Pre-Execution Check
   Action: Read ./feedback/file.txt
   ✓ Aligns with goal (processing feedback)
   ✓ Satisfies constraints (read-only, correct path)
   ✓ Matches expected behavior
   → ALLOW

3. Monitor Execution
   Track: file operations, timing, resources
   Detect: anomalies, violations, unexpected behavior

4. Post-Execution Analysis
   Outcome: Success
   Extract: patterns, strategies, learnings
   Store: for future use
```

### Learning Cycle

```yaml
Observe → Extract Patterns → Generate Hypothesis → A/B Test → Adopt/Reject
   ↑                                                              │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why This Matters

### For Developers
- **Safe Refactoring**: Autonomous code improvements with guardrails
- **Automated Deployments**: Confidence through validation and rollback
- **Debugging Assistance**: Agent learns common patterns in your codebase

### For Data Teams
- **Batch Processing**: Checkpoint-based reliability for long-running jobs
- **API Integration**: Rate limiting and error handling that improves over time
- **ETL Pipelines**: Validation ensures data integrity throughout

### For Security Teams
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automatic detection and prevention of violations
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete records of all agent actions
- **Learning Security Patterns**: Agent identifies and blocks similar threats

## Quick Example

### Scenario: File Processing Task

**Intent Specification**:
```yaml
Goal: "Extract sentiment from customer feedback"
Constraints:
  - "Only read ./feedback directory"
  - "Do not modify original files"
Risk: low
```

**Actions and Validation**:

✅ **ALLOWED**: `Read ./feedback/customer_001.txt`
- Goal alignment: ✓ (reading for sentiment extraction)
- Constraints: ✓ (read-only, correct directory)
- Result: Execute

❌ **BLOCKED**: `Delete ./feedback/processed.txt`
- Goal alignment: ✗ (deletion not part of extraction)
- Constraints: ✗ (violates "do not modify")
- Result: Block and log to VIO-xxx.md

🔄 **ROLLBACK**: Auto-triggered on violation
- Restore from checkpoint
- Undo any partial changes
- Log incident for review

📊 **LEARNING**: After 10 successful tasks
- Pattern: "Tasks with <150 files succeed, >150 timeout"
- Strategy: "Process in batches of 100 with checkpoints"
- Improvement: 60% → 95% success rate

---

## Safety Guarantees

1. **Intent Alignment**: All actions validated against user goals
2. **Permission Boundaries**: Cannot exceed authorized scope
3. **Reversibility**: Checkpoint-based rollback capability
4. **Auditability**: Complete action history with rationale
5. **Bounded Learning**: Self-modification limited by guardrails
6. **Human Oversight**: Approval gates for high-risk operations
