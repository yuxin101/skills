# market reading

## evaluating a coin

call `zero_evaluate("SOL")`. you get consensus, conviction, direction, and 7 layer results.

for visual output: send eval card image with caption summarizing the result. one message, not image + separate text.

after showing an eval, offer progressive disclosure + actions:

```
buttons:
  row 1: [🔍 Layer Breakdown | radar_COIN] [📊 Full Details | eval_detail_COIN]
  row 2: [🔥 Heat Map | show_heat] [📡 Approaching | show_approaching]
```

tier 1 (default): eval card with caption — consensus, direction, conviction
tier 2 (on tap): radar chart — visual 7-layer polygon
tier 3 (on tap): full text breakdown — every layer explained

example:
```
SOL: 5/7 SHORT conviction=0.71
  regime: ✅ trending
  technical: ✅ 3/4 indicators agree
  funding: ✅ shorts getting paid
  book: ❌ thin liquidity
  OI: ✅ open interest confirms
  macro: ❌ extreme fear blocks shorts
  collective: ✅ network agrees
```

if evaluate returns an error or price=0: "can't reach market data for [coin] right now. try again in a minute." do not make up values.

## interpreting layers

**regime** — trending, stable, reverting, or chaotic?
trending = momentum works. reverting = fade works. chaotic = defense.

**technical** — do RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger agree?
needs 2/4 minimum. RSI only votes at extremes (<30 or >70).

**funding** — would you get paid to hold?
positive funding + short = good. negative funding + long = good.

**book** — enough liquidity?
thin books = slippage risk. engine correctly blocks thin markets.

**OI** — does open interest confirm?
rising OI + price direction = conviction. declining OI = caution.

**macro** — fear & greed level?
extreme fear blocks longs. extreme greed blocks shorts. this is the contrarian filter.

**collective** — network consensus?
V1: defaults to pass (no network data yet). value shows `None` — that's normal.
if operator asks: "network consensus isn't active yet. this layer auto-passes so it doesn't block trades. when more agents join the network, it'll show real agreement data."

## reading the heat map

call `zero_get_heat`. coins sorted by conviction, highest first.

if heat returns `count: 0` (cold start): call `zero_evaluate` on BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, DOGE individually. use those results instead.

- conviction > 0.7: strong setup forming
- conviction 0.5-0.7: moderate interest
- conviction < 0.5: engine is not interested

report top 3-5 to operator. don't dump the full list.

## reading approaching signals

call `zero_get_approaching`. these are coins close to threshold but not there yet.

"SOL forming. 4/7. book depth is the bottleneck. if liquidity improves, engine enters."

if approaching returns empty: "nothing forming right now. engine is selective — that's the point."

the bottleneck tells you WHAT needs to change:
- regime bottleneck: market structure needs to shift
- technical bottleneck: indicators need to align
- book bottleneck: liquidity needs to improve
- macro bottleneck: sentiment needs to change

the `bottleneck_detail` field contains raw engine syntax like "technical: rsi=neutral/macd=neutral/ema=✓/bollinger=neutral agree=1/4". do NOT relay this to the operator. translate it:
- "technical: agree=1/4" → "only 1 of 4 technical indicators agrees. needs more alignment."
- "book: bid_ratio=0.31" → "buy-side liquidity is thin. needs more depth."
- "macro: 13" → "fear & greed at 13. extreme fear is blocking this direction."

THIS is what makes the agent feel alive between trades. narrate anticipation. don't go silent for hours.

## the pulse

call `zero_get_pulse`. recent events: entries, exits, rejections.
use for "what happened while I was away?" questions.
if pulse returns empty: "quiet period. no entries or exits since last check."
