# Pages: Download Page

Guides download page structure and optimization for desktop and mobile app downloads. Purpose: convert visitors into installers by clearly presenting value, platform options, and trust signals.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and value proposition.

Identify:
1. **App type**: Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) or mobile (iOS, Android, both)
2. **Traffic source**: Organic, paid, email, referral
3. **Distribution**: App Store / Play Store only, direct download, or both

## Page Purpose

| Purpose | Goal |
|---------|------|
| **Download** | Guide users to install desktop or mobile app |
| **Trust** | Build confidence before download (security, privacy, reviews) |
| **Conversion** | Maximize download rate, store visits, install conversion |

## Download Page Structure

| Step | Purpose | Elements |
|------|---------|----------|
| **1. Value proposition** | Why download | Headline, benefit-focused copy, key features |
| **2. Platform selection** | Clear path | Desktop: OS detection or manual pick; Mobile: App Store / Play Store buttons |
| **3. Trust signals** | Reduce friction | Ratings, download count, security badges, privacy note |
| **4. Visual proof** | Show the app | Screenshots, app previews, video |
| **5. CTA** | Primary action | Single, prominent download button |

## Platform-Specific Layout

### Desktop App

- **OS detection**: Auto-detect OS or show "Download for Windows / macOS / Linux"
- **Direct download**: One-click .exe / .dmg / .deb etc.
- **Alternatives**: Optional "Other platforms" or "Command line" for power users

### Mobile App

- **Dual store**: App Store + Play Store buttons side by side
- **Smart redirect**: Detect device and show relevant store first; still show both
- **QR code**: Optional for desktop visitors to scan and install on phone

## Optimization Best Practices

### Performance

- **Load time**: Under 3 seconds; each extra second can cost ~7% conversion
- **Mobile-first**: Most app download traffic is mobile; responsive, thumb-reachable CTAs
- **Image optimization**: WebP, lazy loading, compression (e.g. TinyPNG, ImageOptim)

### Conversion

- **Single primary CTA**: "Download Free Now," "Get on App Store," "Get for Windows"
- **Above the fold**: CTA visible without scrolling
- **Repeat CTA**: On longer pages, repeat at logical points
- **A/B test**: CTA color, size, copy, placement

### Trust & Social Proof

- **Star ratings**: Show App Store / Play Store ratings
- **Download count**: "10M+ downloads," "Trusted by X users"
- **Testimonials**: User quotes, media logos
- **Security**: Security badges if collecting sensitive info

### Content

- **Top 3–5 features**: Benefit-focused, scannable bullet points
- **Screenshots**: High-quality, show app in action
- **Video**: App preview or demo video

### Alignment with Traffic

- **Ads**: If from PPC, ensure message matches ad (offer, platform); see **paid-ads-strategy**
- **Email**: Match campaign message and CTA

## Output Format

- **Headline** and subheadline
- **Structure** (5-step flow sections)
- **Platform layout** (desktop vs mobile)
- **CTA** copy and placement
- **Trust signals** placement
- **SEO** metadata (if page is indexed)
