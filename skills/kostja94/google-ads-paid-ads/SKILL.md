# Paid Ads: Google Ads

Guides Google Ads setup, campaign structure, keyword targeting, and optimization. Google Ads excels at high-intent search traffic; use when people actively search for your solution.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Two Modes: PMF Testing vs Conversion-Driven

| Mode | When | Budget | Landing page | Metrics |
|------|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **PMF testing** | Pre-PMF; validate idea before building | $47–500; start small | Simple LP: headline, benefits, problem solved, CTA ("Join Waitlist," "Get Early Access") | CTR, sign-up rate, bounce rate; low CTR/high bounce = messaging/positioning issue |
| **Conversion-driven** | PMF validated; commercialization | Scale; ROAS target | Full funnel; ad-to-page alignment | ROAS, CAC, conversion rate |

**PMF testing**: No full product needed. Build landing page with Unbounce, Carrd, or Webflow. Run ads to relevant search terms; measure clicks, engagement, signups. Test messaging (e.g., "Fastest App for Freelancers" vs "Simplest Time Tracker for Teams"), pricing (different price points in ads/LP), and audiences (keyword targeting, in-market). Allow 4–6 weeks for PMax learning phase. Use as learning tool, not just marketing channel.

## Campaign Structure

```
Account
├── Campaign: Brand (Search)
├── Campaign: Non-Brand (Search)
├── Campaign: Competitor (Search) — optional; bid on competitor brand + "alternative"/"vs"
├── Campaign: Retargeting (Display)
└── Campaign: Performance Max
```

### Competitor Brand Keywords

**When**: Bid on "[Competitor] alternative," "[Competitor] vs [You]" to intercept high-intent traffic. Google allows competitor terms as keywords; you cannot use competitor names in ad copy without permission.

**Landing page**: Use a **dedicated landing page** (comparison/alternatives page), not a blog article. Users searching competitor brands expect direct alternatives—a blog increases bounce; a comparison page matches intent and converts better. See **alternatives-page-generator** for structure.

**Best practices**:
- Separate campaign; exact/phrase match; add your brand as negative
- H1 mirrors search intent (e.g., "[Competitor] vs [You]")
- Feature comparison table; one-line differentiator; strong CTA
- Expect lower Quality Score, higher CPC than non-brand; optimize LP relevance

**Naming**: `GOOG_[Objective]_[Audience]_[Offer]_[Date]` (e.g., `GOOG_Search_Brand_Demo_Ongoing`)

## Campaign Types

| Type | Best for |
|------|----------|
| **Search** | High-intent queries; keyword-targeted; landing page critical |
| **Display** | Awareness; retargeting; broader reach |
| **YouTube** | Video; awareness; consideration |
| **Performance Max** | Automated; cross-channel; feed + search + display |

## Performance Max (PMax) Optimization

**Learning period**: Run at least **6 weeks** for algorithm ramp-up. Works best as complement to Search, not replacement.

**Asset groups**: Organize by *audience intent* (e.g., high-intent searchers, cart abandoners, category researchers), not product category alone. Audience signals improve CPA and ROAS vs. no signals.

**Asset requirements** (per asset group):
- ≥5 images (include 1200×1200)
- ≥5 text assets (4 headlines, 5 descriptions)
- Video when possible
- Refresh creative regularly to maintain performance

**Signals**: Add remarketing lists and Customer Match to accelerate learning.

**Weekly health check**: Flag if brand terms &gt;30% of conversions; unexpected geo conversions; any placement &gt;15% of total spend; asset group performance below "Good."

## Keyword Strategy

- **Brand**: Protect brand terms; exclude from non-brand campaigns
- **Negative keywords**: Build weekly; avoid irrelevant queries. Add **support terms** (login, forum, pricing, help) from **keyword-research**—these are existing customers, not prospects.
- **Match types**: Broad (discovery) → Phrase → Exact (control)

**Keyword sources**: Use **keyword-research** for keyword list, clusters, and intent. Map each cluster to a dedicated landing page; relevance improves Quality Score and lowers CPC.

## Quality Score Levers

| Factor | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Expected CTR | Improve ad relevance; test headlines |
| Ad relevance | Align ad copy to keyword intent |
| Landing page | Ad-to-page alignment; fast load; mobile-friendly |

**Target**: Quality Score ≥6; higher = lower CPC, better ad rank. **Benchmark**: Improving Quality Score from 5 to 7 can reduce CPC by 30–50%.

## Bidding Strategy

| Conversions/month | Strategy |
|-------------------|----------|
| &lt;30 | Manual CPC (smart bidding needs volume to optimize) |
| 30–50 | Target CPA; minimum for effective smart bidding |
| 50–100 | Target CPA |
| 100+ | Target ROAS |

**Smart bidding**: AI-powered bidding (Target CPA, Target ROAS) typically delivers better ROI than manual when conversion volume is sufficient; requires ≥30 conversions in 30 days to work effectively.

## Tracking

- **Enhanced Conversions**: Server-side signals for better attribution
- **Offline conversion imports**: B2B; CRM → Google Ads
- **UTM**: Consistent parameters for GA4 cross-check

## Paid–Organic Cannibalization

When you rank organically (position 4+) for a keyword and also run PPC, paid ads can absorb clicks that would go to organic. **Audit**: Cross-reference GSC organic rankings with Search Terms report. If organic ranks well, test pausing PPC on those terms to free budget for higher-impact keywords.
