# SEO Content: Content Strategy

Guides content strategy for SEO: topic clusters, pillar pages, cluster articles, and editorial planning. For content marketing across all channels (blog, email, social, video), see **content-marketing**. For translation workflow and multilingual content, see **translation**.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and proof points.

Identify:
1. **Keywords**: From keyword research — see **keyword-research** for discovery and clustering
2. **Existing content**: What already exists
3. **Resources**: Content capacity, tools
4. **Goals**: Traffic, conversions, authority

**Product-Led SEO**: Do SEO around product/users, not around industry/search engines. See **seo-strategy** for Product-Led SEO principle, products suited for SEO, and workflow order.

## Topic Clusters

Topic clusters organize content by **topic** rather than isolated keywords. A **pillar page** covers a broad core topic; **cluster articles** cover subtopics; all connect via internal links. This signals topical authority to search engines and AI systems.

### Structure

```
Pillar page (broad topic, 2,000-5,000+ words)
    <-> internal links
Cluster 1 (subtopic, 800-2,500 words)
Cluster 2 (subtopic)
...
Cluster 6-12 (subtopics)
    <-> cluster to cluster links
```

### Pillar Page

| Attribute | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Length** | 2,000-5,000+ words; comprehensive guide |
| **Keyword** | Broad head term with search volume |
| **Role** | Hub; links to all cluster articles; targets primary topic |
| **Conversion** | Link to product/feature pages where relevant |

### Cluster Articles

| Attribute | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Count** | 6-12 articles per pillar (minimum 6 for authority) |
| **Length** | 800-2,500 words each; focused on one subtopic |
| **Keyword** | Long-tail, specific intent per article |
| **Links** | Each cluster links to pillar; pillar links back; related clusters link to each other |

### Internal Linking Model

| Link type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pillar to Cluster** | Hub distributes authority; users discover subtopics |
| **Cluster to Pillar** | Signals relationship; passes equity to hub |
| **Cluster to Cluster** | Related subtopics; strengthens topical coverage |

### Structure and Content Equally Important

**Framework and body quality both matter**: TOC, chapter logic, and content depth are all essential for SEO and UX. Weak structure undermines strong writing; weak writing undermines strong structure. Plan both from the start.

### Why Topic Clusters Work

- **Topical authority**: Rank for multiple variations; comprehensive coverage signals expertise
- **Avoid cannibalization**: One page per topic/keyword; no competing pages
- **Better internal linking**: Clear logic; crawlers understand structure
- **AI citations**: Clustered content gets ~42% more AI citations than standalone
- **Traffic**: ~30% more organic traffic; rankings hold ~2.5x longer

### Implementation Steps

1. **Choose 3-7 core topics** -> business relevance, search demand, competitive opportunity
2. **Map subtopics** -> People Also Ask, competitor analysis, keyword tools
3. **Content audit** -> Identify existing pages that can become pillar or cluster; find gaps
4. **Build clusters first** (optional) -> Cluster pages often rank first; add pillar after
5. **Create pillar** -> Comprehensive guide; link to all clusters
6. **Establish links** -> Pillar <-> cluster; cluster <-> cluster
7. **Update quarterly** -> Maintain freshness and authority

### Example

- **Pillar**: "SEO Guide" (targets "SEO")
- **Clusters**: "Technical SEO," "On-Page SEO," "Link Building," "Content SEO," "Local SEO," "E-E-A-T"

## Content Types

| Type | Use | SEO Fit |
|------|-----|---------|
| **How-to guides** | Informational intent; high share potential | High -> matches search intent |
| **Comparisons** | Commercial intent; "X vs Y" | High |
| **List posts** | "Top 10," "Best X" | High |
| **Glossaries** | Definition queries; internal link hub | High |
| **Tools/calculators** | Linkable assets; engagement | High |
| **Case studies** | Proof; conversion support | Medium -> supports conversion |
| **Funding / PR** | Funding rounds, acquisitions | Low -> brand/PR, not search-driven |
| **Product updates** | Feature launches, release notes | Low -> internal audience |
| **News / Trending** | Industry news, hot topics | Medium -> quick spikes, short shelf life |

### Evergreen vs Timely Content Mix

- **Evergreen** (70-75%): Pillar guides, how-tos, comparisons, glossaries. Drives long-term traffic, backlinks, authority. Refresh every 6-12 months.
- **Timely** (25-30%): Seasonal, trending, news. Generates quick traffic, shows topical relevance. Link timely pieces into evergreen pillars.
- **Balance**: Too much evergreen = blog feels stale; too much timely = irregular traffic, constant content churn.

## Editorial Calendar

- Map keywords to content pieces
- Prioritize by opportunity (volume -> intent -> feasibility)
- Schedule by capacity
- Include update schedule for existing content

## Output Format

- **Topic cluster** map (pillar + 6-12 clusters)
- **Content calendar** (topics, keywords, deadlines)
- **Internal linking** plan
- **Update plan** for existing content
