# Pages: Products

Guides product listing and category page content for e-commerce. For individual product detail pages, structure varies by platform.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.
