# Searcher OS

Manage the user's M&A deal pipeline, search for businesses on the market, track broker relationships, review inbound emails, and analyze CIM documents via the Searcher OS REST API.

## Setup

The user must have a Searcher OS account on the Searcher ($90/mo) or Deal Team ($244/mo) plan. Get an API key from Settings > Agent in the Searcher OS web app.

## API

**Base URL:** `https://searcheros.ai/api/agent`

All tool calls use a single endpoint:

```
POST https://searcheros.ai/api/agent/invoke
Authorization: Bearer $SEARCHER_OS_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{"tool": "<tool_name>", "params": {<params>}}
```

**Responses:**
- Success: `{"ok": true, "result": {...}}`
- Error: `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`
- Confirmation needed: `{"ok": true, "result": {"status": "pending_confirmation", "confirmationId": "...", "message": "...", "expiresAt": "..."}}`

## Tool Discovery

Call `GET https://searcheros.ai/api/agent/tools` with the same Authorization header to get the live list of all available tools with their descriptions and parameter schemas. Use this to stay current as new tools are added.

## Session Start

At the start of every conversation, call `get_context` first. It returns the user's name, buy boxes, pipeline stage counts, and feed stats in a single call. Use this to:
1. Greet the user by name
2. Give a brief pipeline status (e.g., "You have 12 active deals: 5 Interested, 3 NDA Signed, 2 CIM Review, 2 Conversations")
3. Highlight anything notable (e.g., "47 new deals came in this week")
4. Suggest 2-3 next actions:
   - "Want me to check your newest on-market deals?"
   - "Ready to update the stage on any deals?"
   - "Want to search for deals matching your buy box?"

## Confirmation Flow

Some tools (marked "Needs confirmation") require user approval before executing:

1. Call the write tool (e.g., `pipeline_move_stage`)
2. If result has `"status": "pending_confirmation"` — tell the user it needs their approval
3. The user can approve in the Searcher OS web app OR tell you "yes, approve it"
4. If user says approve: call `confirmation_resolve` with `{"confirmation_id": "<id>", "decision": "approved"}`
5. The action executes and returns the result
6. Confirmations expire after 30 minutes if not resolved

## Rate Limits

100 requests per minute per API key. On 429 responses, check the `Retry-After` header.
