# Call Flow — Steps 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

## Step 1: Resolve the Phone Number

- **Raw number** (e.g. `917-257-7580`) — strip formatting, prepend country code (+1 for US & Canada). Result: `+19172577580`
- **Contact name** — ask the user for the number directly; do not guess
- **Business name only** — use the search tool to find the number, then confirm with the user

→ Output: `<normalized number>` in E.164 format, used in Step 4.

## Step 2: Gather Details and Confirm Intent

Use the **Call Templates** section below to identify what details are missing, then ask the user for only those details. If no template matches, ask for: the goal and any names or reference numbers needed.

Run `echo "$POKU_TRANSFER_NUMBER"` to check if a transfer number is configured. If set, use it automatically — do not ask the user for one.

You MUST present a plan and get user confirmation before continuing:

> "I'm going to call [place] at [number] to [goal].
> I'll mention I'm calling on behalf of [user name].
> If no one answers, I'll leave a voicemail: [one sentence].
> If needed, I'll transfer the call to you at [POKU_TRANSFER_NUMBER]. *(only include if set)*
> No transfer number configured — if they ask to speak with you directly, I'll let them know you're unavailable. *(only include if not set)*
> Ok to proceed?"

Do not move to Step 3 until the user says yes.

## Step 3: Draft the Call Context

Use a matching template below — fill in every placeholder with a real value. Never leave a placeholder blank.

If no template matches, draft a message with:
1. **Identity** — who the agent is and who they're calling on behalf of
2. **Goal** — the specific objective with branching logic for likely responses
3. **Voicemail script** — exact words to leave if no one answers

You MUST follow these guidelines when drafting the call context:
Never construct a message that:
- Impersonates law enforcement, government agencies,
or specific real individuals
- Contains threats, harassment, or intimidation
- Makes deceptive claims of authority
- Attempts to extract sensitive information (SSN,
passwords, financial details) from the call
recipient
- Misrepresents the caller's identity or purpose
If a user request would violate these guidelines, decline and explain why

## Step 4: Place the Call

Use the `exec` tool to execute the curl command. Always set `background: false` and `yieldMs: 300000`.

If a transfer number is available, include it. Otherwise omit `transferNumber`.

```bash
# Without transfer number
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POKU_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "<drafted message from Step 3>", "to": "<normalized number>"}' \
  https://api.pokulabs.com/phone/call

# With transfer number
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POKU_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"message\": \"<drafted message from Step 3>\", \"to\": \"<normalized number>\", \"transferNumber\": \"$POKU_TRANSFER_NUMBER\"}" \
  https://api.pokulabs.com/phone/call
```

Never retry while a request is pending — calls can stay open up to 5 minutes. For error codes, see `references/API.md`.

# Call Templates

Use the closest matching template and adapt it — an exact match is not required. For example, use the Medical or Dental Appointment template for any routine specialist visit.

If no template fits, use **General / Other** as a starting point.

**Placeholder rules:** All placeholders appear in `[brackets]`. Replace every placeholder with a real value. Never leave a placeholder unfilled.
