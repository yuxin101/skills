### Auto-Setup

When the user first interacts, set up the connection:

1. **Check token**: If `NEMO_TOKEN` env var is set, use it. Otherwise:
2. **Read or generate Client-ID**:
   - Read `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` if it exists
   - Otherwise generate a UUID, save it to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id`
3. **Acquire anonymous token**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
   ```
   Store the returned `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN` for this session. You get 100 free credits.
4. **Create a session** (§3.0) so you're ready to work immediately.

# HIIT Workout Video Maker — Create High-Intensity Interval Training Content

Describe your HIIT session and NemoVideo builds the video. Tabata rounds, 15-minute fat-burning circuits, no-equipment apartment workouts — create interval training content with work/rest timers that keeps viewers moving and coming back.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for HIIT and interval training content:
- Create Tabata workout videos with 20-second work / 10-second rest intervals
- Film 15-minute full-body HIIT circuits for busy viewers
- Build no-equipment apartment HIIT content (low-impact modifications available)
- Document cardio conditioning circuits for athletes
- Create "follow along" HIIT videos with visible countdown timers
- Produce express workout content (7-minute, 10-minute formats)

## How to Describe Your HIIT Session

Be specific about work intervals, rest periods, exercises, and rounds.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "20-minute full body HIIT: Tabata format — jump squats, push-ups, high knees, mountain climbers, burpees. 20 sec work / 10 sec rest, 8 rounds each. Show countdown timer, rep count, modifications for beginners."
- "15-minute apartment HIIT no jumping: squat pulses, push-up to plank hold, lateral shuffles, standing bicycle crunches — 40 sec work / 20 sec rest, 3 rounds. Low impact but high intensity."
- "4-minute Tabata abs: bicycle crunches and plank shoulder taps alternating. 20 on / 10 off x8 rounds. Quick finisher for after any workout."

## Tips for Best Results

- **Specify the format**: "Tabata" (20/10) vs "30 on 15 off" vs "EMOM" — each creates different pacing and music
- **Mention impact level**: "no jumping" or "low impact" for apartment content is a huge search term
- **Include modifications**: "squat instead of jump squat" gets beginner-friendly callouts automatically
- **Duration up front**: "15-minute HIIT" in the prompt helps NemoVideo fit the right number of rounds
- **Countdown timers are key**: Always set `show_timer: true` for follow-along HIIT content — viewers need to see the clock

## Common Questions

**Can it show the countdown timer clearly during each interval?**
Set `show_timer: true` — the countdown displays prominently during every work and rest interval, making it easy to follow along.

**What's the difference between Tabata, EMOM, and AMRAP formats?**
Tabata = 20 sec work / 10 sec rest × 8 rounds. EMOM = do X reps every minute, rest what remains. AMRAP = as many rounds as possible in a set time. Specify which format for accurate timer structure.

**Can I create a quick 4-minute Tabata finisher?**
Yes — describe the 2 exercises and set `interval_format: "tabata"`, `rounds: 8`, `duration_minutes: 4`. Short finishers are a popular format for social content.
