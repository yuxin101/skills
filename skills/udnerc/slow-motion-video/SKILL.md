  Slow Motion Video — Create Slow Motion and Speed Ramp Effects with AI.
  Frame-accurate speed control through conversation. Upload your video and describe where you want time to slow down or ramp: 'slow down to 0.25x right when the ball hits' or 'speed ramp from normal to 50% at the 8-second mark.' The AI handles precise frame-level speed adjustments, smooth velocity curves, and multi-point ramping in a single clip. Works for sports highlight reels, dance videos, action sequences, product reveals, and any footage where timing is part of the story. Combine speed effects with color grading, music, and text overlays in the same session. No keyframe animation knowledge needed — describe the effect, get the output. Preserves original resolution. Export as MP4. Supports mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv.
  
  Works by connecting to the NemoVideo AI backend at mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai.
  Supports MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM. Free trial available.
