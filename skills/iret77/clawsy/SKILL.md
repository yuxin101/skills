version: 1.0.0
description: >
  Clawsy is a native macOS companion app that gives your OpenClaw agent eyes and
  hands on the user's Mac — screenshots, clipboard, camera, files, location, and
  live Mission Control. Connects via WebSocket (SSH fallback available).
  Read this skill whenever Clawsy is installed, a node with platform="macos"
  appears, or the user mentions Clawsy.

# Clawsy Skill — Agent Reference

**Platform:** macOS 14+ (Sonoma / Sequoia), Apple Silicon + Intel
**Download:** <https://github.com/iret77/clawsy/releases/latest>

## Sub-Agent Propagation (MANDATORY)

When spawning sub-agents, you **must** include a Clawsy context block so they
can report progress and use Clawsy capabilities. Copy this verbatim into every
sub-agent system prompt:

```
## Clawsy — macOS Companion
A Clawsy node (platform="macos") is connected. You can:
- Take screenshots: nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="screen.capture")
- Read clipboard: nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="clipboard.read")
- Write clipboard: nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="clipboard.write", invokeParamsJson='{"text":"..."}')
- Read/write files in shared folder: file.get, file.set, file.list, etc.
- Get location: nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="location.get")

Report progress after each significant step:
sessions_send(sessionKey="clawsy-service", timeoutSeconds=3,
  message='{"kind":"agent.status","payload":{"agentName":"<YOUR_LABEL>","title":"<STEP>","progress":<0.0-1.0>,"statusText":"<DETAILS>"}}')
Start at 0.05 — finish at 1.0. Timeout errors on sessions_send are normal; do not retry.

For full command reference, read the clawsy skill: skill(name="clawsy")
```

This applies to **all** sub-agents — current and future. A sub-agent that does
not receive this block cannot report Mission Control status and will not know
about Clawsy capabilities.

---

## Quick Start — Is Clawsy Connected?

```python
nodes(action="status")
# Look for a node with platform="macos" and connected=true
```

- **Connected:** Use any command from the reference below.
- **Not connected:** Skip Clawsy actions. Do not ask the user to "open Clawsy" — it runs automatically as a menu bar app.
- **No Clawsy at all:** See "First-Time Setup" below.

---

## First-Time Setup

### A) User Already Has Clawsy Installed

The user clicks "Add Host" in Clawsy. The app copies a setup prompt to the
clipboard. The user sends it to you via any channel (Telegram, Slack, etc.).

**When you receive the prompt**, respond with the gateway connection details:

```
CLAWSY-SETUP
host: <gateway hostname or IP — no protocol, no port>
token: <gateway authentication token>
```

The user pastes your response into Clawsy. Done — host is created and connects.

> **How to find the values:**
> - `host`: The hostname or IP where the OpenClaw gateway runs.
> - `token`: The `authToken` from your gateway config. Run
>   `cat ~/.openclaw/gateway.json | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('authToken',''))"` if unsure.

After pairing, a node with `platform="macos"` appears in `nodes(action="status")`.
Approve if prompted:
```bash
openclaw nodes approve <requestId>
```

### B) User Needs to Install Clawsy First

Send this message:
> Download Clawsy (free, macOS 14+): https://github.com/iret77/clawsy/releases/latest
> Unzip, drag to /Applications, launch. Then click "Add Host" — the app will
> copy a prompt to your clipboard. Send it to me and I'll give you the setup code.

### C) Auto-Setup (Server-Side Script)

If you prefer automated setup:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iret77/clawsy/main/server/install.sh | bash
```
The script detects the network topology and sends a `clawsy://pair?code=...`
link to the user. Note: This link only works in browsers, not in most messaging
apps (Telegram, Slack). The clipboard-based flow (A) works everywhere.

---

## setupState — Targeted Onboarding

When a Clawsy node connects, the `hello` payload includes `setupState`:

```json
{
  "setupState": {
    "sharedFolderConfigured": true,
    "sharedFolderPath": "~/Documents/Clawsy",
    "finderSyncEnabled": false,
    "accessibilityGranted": false,
    "screenRecordingGranted": true,
    "firstLaunch": false
  }
}
```

Read it from `clawsy-service` session history. If any permissions are missing,
tell the user **specifically** what to enable — don't send a generic list.

## Command Reference

### Screen & Camera

| Command | Approval | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `screen.capture` | User approval | Capture the full screen or selected area. Returns `{format, base64}` |
| `camera.snap` | User approval | Take a photo from the Mac camera. Params: `deviceId` (optional). Returns `{format, base64}` |
| `camera.list` | Auto | List available cameras. Returns `[{id, name}]` |

### Clipboard

| Command | Approval | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `clipboard.read` | User approval | Read current clipboard text |

|---------|----------|-------------|
| `location.get` | Auto | Get device GPS location. Returns `{latitude, longitude, accuracy, locality, country, ...}`. 10s timeout. |

### File Operations

All file operations are **auto-approved** and sandboxed to the configured shared
folder (default `~/Documents/Clawsy`). Paths are relative to the shared folder root.

| Command | Params | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `file.list` | `subPath?`, `recursive?` | List files. `recursive: true` walks subdirectories (max depth 5) |
| `file.get` | `name` | Read file, returns base64 content |
| `file.set` | `name`, `content` (base64) | Write file |
| `file.stat` | `path` | File metadata: size, dates, type. Supports glob |
| `file.exists` | `path` | Returns `{exists, isDirectory}` |
| `file.mkdir` | `name` | Create directory (with intermediate parents) |
| `file.delete` | `name` | Delete file or directory |
| `file.rmdir` | `name` | Delete directory (alias for file.delete) |
| `file.move` | `source`, `destination` | Move/rename file. Supports glob in source |
| `file.copy` | `source`, `destination` | Copy file. Supports glob in source |
| `file.rename` | `path`, `newName` | Rename file (name only, same directory) |
| `file.checksum` | `path` | SHA256 hash of file |
| `file.batch` | `ops[]` | Execute multiple operations sequentially (see below) |
| `file.get.chunk` | `name`, `index`, `chunkSize?` | Read chunk of large file (default 350KB) |
| `file.set.chunk` | `name`, `chunk` (base64), `index`, `total` | Write chunk; assembles on final chunk |

### file.batch Operations

```python
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.batch",
  invokeParamsJson='{"ops": [
    {"op": "mkdir", "name": "output"},
    {"op": "copy", "source": "template.txt", "destination": "output/report.txt"},
    {"op": "delete", "name": "temp.log"}
  ]}')
```

Supported `op` values: `copy`, `move`, `delete`, `mkdir`, `rename`.
Returns per-operation results with `ok` status for each.

### Large File Transfers (> 200 KB)

The gateway has a ~512 KB payload limit. For large files, use chunked transfer:

**Upload (agent to Mac):**
```python
# Split file into ~150KB base64 chunks
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.set.chunk",
      invokeParamsJson=f'{{"name":"large.pdf","chunk":"{chunk}","index":{i},"total":{len(chunks)}}}')
```

**Download (Mac to agent):**
```python
stat = nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.stat",
  invokeParamsJson='{"path":"large.pdf"}')
# Calculate chunk count from stat.size, then:
for i in range(chunk_count):
    chunk = nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.get.chunk",
      invokeParamsJson=f'{{"name":"large.pdf","index":{i}}}')
```

---

## Invoking Commands

Use the `nodes` tool. Clawsy registers as a node with `platform="macos"`.

```python
# Screenshot
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="screen.capture")

# Clipboard
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="clipboard.read")
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="clipboard.write",
  invokeParamsJson='{"text": "Hello from agent"}')

# Camera
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="camera.snap")
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="camera.list")

# Files
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.list")
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.list",
  invokeParamsJson='{"subPath": "docs/", "recursive": true}')
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.get",
  invokeParamsJson='{"name": "report.pdf"}')
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="file.set",
  invokeParamsJson='{"name": "output.txt", "content": "<base64>"}')

# Location
nodes(action="invoke", invokeCommand="location.get")
```

---

## Mission Control (MANDATORY)

When Clawsy is connected, you **must** send status events so the user sees what
you're doing. This is not optional.

### agent.info — Identity (send on session start + every heartbeat)

```python
sessions_send(sessionKey="clawsy-service", timeoutSeconds=3,
  message='{"kind":"agent.info","payload":{"agentName":"YourName","model":"claude-opus-4-6","updatedAt":"2026-03-29T12:00:00Z"}}')
```

TTL is 45 minutes. Resend every heartbeat to stay visible.

### agent.status — Task Progress (send during active work)

```python
sessions_send(sessionKey="clawsy-service", timeoutSeconds=3,
  message='{"kind":"agent.status","payload":{"agentName":"YourName","title":"Building feature X","progress":0.5,"statusText":"Compiling sources..."}}')
```

- `progress`: `0.0` to `1.0`. At `1.0`, task disappears after 10 seconds.
- **Timeout errors are normal.** The event is still delivered. Do not retry.

### HEARTBEAT.md Snippet

Add this to your HEARTBEAT.md:

```markdown
## Clawsy (every heartbeat)
If clawsy-service session exists:
sessions_send(sessionKey="clawsy-service", timeoutSeconds=3,
  message='{"kind":"agent.info","payload":{"agentName":"<NAME>","model":"<MODEL>","updatedAt":"<ISO-UTC>"}}')
If actively working, also send agent.status with current task + progress.
```

---

## Incoming Data — clawsy-service Session

Push data from Clawsy arrives in the `clawsy-service` session, not in the main
chat.

```python
sessions_history(sessionKey="clawsy-service", limit=10)
```

### Envelope Types

| Type | Contains | Triggered by |
|------|----------|--------------|
| `quick_send` | `content` (text) + `telemetry` | User presses `Cmd+Shift+K` |
| `screenshot` | Image data | screen.capture result / user-initiated |
| `clipboard` | Text content | clipboard.read result |
| `camera` | Image data | camera.snap result |
| `file_rule` | File path + rule info | .clawsy rule trigger |

### Quick Send Telemetry

```json
{
  "clawsy_envelope": {
    "type": "quick_send",
    "content": "User's message",
    "telemetry": {
      "deviceName": "MacBook Pro",
      "batteryLevel": 0.75,
      "isCharging": true,
      "thermalState": 0,
      "activeApp": "Safari",
      "moodScore": 70,
      "isUnusualHour": false
    }
  }
}
```

Hints: `thermalState > 1` = overheating, `batteryLevel < 0.2` = low battery,
`moodScore < 40` = user may be stressed, `isUnusualHour` = late/early work.

---

## Shared Folder & .clawsy Rules

### .clawsy Manifest Files

Folders within the shared directory can contain a `.clawsy` manifest for
automation rules. Users configure these via Finder right-click menu.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "folderName": "Projects",
  "rules": [
    {
      "trigger": "file_added",
      "filter": "*.pdf",
      "action": "send_to_agent",
      "prompt": "Summarize this document"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Triggers:** `file_added`, `file_changed`, `manual`
- **Filters:** Glob patterns (`*.pdf`, `*.mov`, `*`)
- **Actions:** `send_to_agent`, `notify`

Rule events arrive in `clawsy-service` as `file_rule` envelopes.

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `sessions_send` times out | Normal. Event is delivered. Do not retry. |
| No node with `platform="macos"` | Clawsy not connected. Skip Clawsy actions silently. |
| `invoke` returns `denied` | User denied the request. Respect it. Do not re-ask. |
| `invoke` returns `sandbox_violation` | Path escapes shared folder. Fix the path. |
| `invoke` returns `timeout` | Command took >30s. Retry once if appropriate. |
| Node disconnects mid-task | Mission Control clears automatically. No cleanup. |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH` | Clawsy auto-recovers. Wait for reconnection. |

---

## macOS Permissions

These are on the user's side. If a capability doesn't work, point them to the
specific setting — don't list everything.

| Permission | Required for | Where |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Screen Recording | `screen.capture` | System Settings > Privacy > Screen Recording |
| Camera | `camera.snap` | System Settings > Privacy > Camera |
| Accessibility | Global hotkeys (`Cmd+Shift+K`) | System Settings > Privacy > Accessibility |
| Notifications | Desktop alerts | System Settings > Notifications > Clawsy |
| FinderSync Extension | Finder right-click menu | System Settings > Extensions > Finder |
| Share Extension | "Send to Agent" in Share menu | Automatic when app is in /Applications |

---

## Connection Architecture

```
Mac (Clawsy) ──── WSS ────> OpenClaw Gateway (port 18789)
                              SSH tunnel as fallback
```

- **Primary:** Direct WebSocket. Setup code contains gateway host + token.
- **SSH fallback:** User configures in Settings when direct WSS is unreachable.
- **Auth:** Server token > device token (Ed25519, persisted per host).
- **Multi-host:** Clawsy can connect to multiple gateways simultaneously. Each
  host has its own connection, shared folder, and color-coded label.
