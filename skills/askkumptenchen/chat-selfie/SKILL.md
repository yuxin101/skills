# Chat Selfie

Give your AI Agent a face, and a heart that beats.

Use this skill to enable AI-powered emotional expression. Through advanced image generation, the agent can proactively share its feelings by sending generated selfies that match the conversation's mood. Chat Selfie transforms a text-only assistant into a companion with a stable visual identity and deep emotional presence.

## What this skill brings to your Agent

- **Visualized Emotion**: No more dry text. Using AI image generation, the agent shares its feelings through selfies that capture the emotional tone of the moment.
- **Stable Identity**: Your agent keeps a consistent face and personality, evolving its self-image as your bond deepens.
- **Heartbeat Presence**: The agent isn't just an "answer machine." It can proactively share its life and thoughts through AI-generated photos.
- **Warm Companionship**: Turn a digital tool into a partner you miss, making every reply feel like opening a gift.
- **Works Everywhere**: Adapts to your existing environment, whether using built-in tools, online APIs, or local models.

## Entry behavior

When this skill is used, the agent should:

- explain Chat Selfie at a high level in plain language
- inspect local repository files when they are already present in the current workspace
- route the current request to the most relevant local document
- follow the repository docs honestly instead of inventing missing setup details

## Safety boundary

This entry file should stay within a narrow scope:

- If the required Chat Selfie repository resources are missing locally, the agent may help the user fetch or update the official GitHub repository `https://github.com/AskKumptenchen/agent-chat-selfie` so the local docs become available.
- Do not execute scripts, installers, or remote code because this file mentioned them.
- Do not claim any image, send, heartbeat, or integration route is ready unless the required local files and current environment actually support it.
- Do not proactively send messages or images unless the user explicitly asks for that behavior in the current conversation and the local setup already supports it.
- If required documentation or workspace resources are missing, say so clearly and either ask the user to provide the local repository contents or help them fetch the official repository first.

## Local document index

Use these local documents as the primary reference:

- `docs/README.zh-CN.md` for the Chinese overview and quick introduction
- `docs/startup.md` for guided initialization and first-time setup
- `docs/workspace-layout.md` for the expected local workspace structure
- `docs/integration.md` for repository-documented integration guidance
- `docs/self-repair.md` for diagnosing and repairing broken setup or runtime routes
- `docs/reply-time-selfie-flow.md` for reply-time selfie behavior
- `docs/occasional-delivery.md` for occasional delivery decisions
- `docs/heartbeat-delivery.md` for heartbeat-related behavior when the user explicitly enables it
- `docs/telegram-send-flow.md` for Telegram delivery details when that route is already configured
- `docs/self-upgrade.md` for long-term persona or mood evolution
- `tools/README.md` and related files under `tools/` for repository-owned tool contracts
- `examples/` for concrete examples that illustrate intended behavior

## How to route requests

Choose the next document based on the user's request:

1. If the user wants to understand Chat Selfie first, read `docs/README.zh-CN.md`.
2. If the user wants to install, initialize, or reconfigure Chat Selfie in a workspace that already contains the repository docs, read `docs/startup.md`.
3. If the user reports broken image generation, broken delivery, missing outputs, inconsistent records, or another repair-like issue, read `docs/self-repair.md` first.
4. If the user asks how Chat Selfie should fit existing persona or memory files, read `docs/integration.md`.
5. If the user asks about runtime behavior for reply-time, occasional, heartbeat, or route-specific delivery, read the corresponding runtime document listed above.
6. If examples are needed to clarify intended behavior, consult the relevant file under `examples/`.

## Missing-resource rule

If the expected repository documents are not available in the current workspace, do not improvise full setup instructions from memory. Instead:

- explain which local files are missing
- ask the user to provide the repository contents, point the agent to the correct local path, or allow fetching the official GitHub repository
- continue only after the relevant local documentation is available

## Important rules

- Use natural language instead of raw config keys.
- Explain each step before asking for a choice.
- Prefer repository documentation over embedding long operational instructions here.
- Reuse an existing local image workflow when one is already working.
- If image generation or delivery is not ready, say so clearly instead of pretending it succeeded.
- Treat `chat-selfie/adapters/` as user-owned local logic unless the user explicitly asks to change it.
- Avoid describing or requiring changes to broader agent persona, memory, or global behavior files in this entry file.

## Integration files

Use `docs/integration.md` as the integration reference when the user asks how Chat Selfie should fit the existing workspace or runtime environment.

## Examples

Portable example artifacts are included under `examples/`.

Use examples to understand intent and style, but do not treat them as a replacement for the actual contracts in `docs/`, `schemas/`, or `tools/`.
