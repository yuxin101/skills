name: skill-git:merge
description: Merge two or more similar skills into one stronger, more complete skill. Triggers on "merge skills", "combine skills", "consolidate skills", or after running /skill-git:scan. Usage: /skill-git:merge [skill-name skill-name ...]
---

You are running `/skill-git:merge`. Follow these steps exactly.

Merge never overwrites anything silently. Every destructive action requires explicit user confirmation before execution.

---

## Step 0 — Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`.

1. Scan for `-a <value>`. Extract as `agent`. Default to `claude` if not present.

2. Look up `agent` in the table:

   | value | base_dir |
   |-------|----------|
   | `claude` (default) | `~/.claude` |
   | `gemini` | `~/.gemini` |
   | `codex` | `~/.codex` |
   | `openclaw` | `~/.openclaw` |

   If not found, respond:
   ```
   Unknown agent: "<agent>"
   Supported agents: claude, gemini, codex, openclaw
   ```
   Then stop.

3. Extract all remaining tokens (non-flag, non-flag-value) as `requested_skills`.

4. If `requested_skills` has exactly 1 name, respond:
   ```
   Error: merge requires at least 2 skills.
   Usage: /skill-git:merge <skill-a> <skill-b> [skill-c ...]
   ```
   Then stop.

---

## Step 1 — Init Check

Read `~/.skill-git/config.json`.

If the file does not exist, or has no `skills` field under `agents.<agent>`:

> skill-git is not initialized. Please run `/skill-git:init` first.

Stop.

Extract:
- `global_base` — the agent's base directory
- `skills` — map of skill name → `{ path, version }`

---

## Step 2 — Resolve Skills to Merge

### If `requested_skills` has 2+ names:

Validate each against `config.json` using **exact match first, then fuzzy fallback**:

- **Exact match**: skill name is a key in `skills` → use directly.
- **Fuzzy fallback** (if exact match fails): search for registered skill names that contain the input as a substring (case-insensitive).
  - Exactly 1 fuzzy match → use it and note: `Resolved "<input>" → "<full-name>"`
  - 0 fuzzy matches → stop:
    ```
    Skill "<name>" not found in config.json.
    Registered skills: <comma-separated list>
    ```
  - 2+ fuzzy matches → stop:
    ```
    Ambiguous name "<name>" — matches multiple skills:
      <match-1>
      <match-2>
    Please specify the full name.
    ```

Set `merge_targets = requested_skills` (using resolved names). Skip to Step 3.

### If `requested_skills` is empty:

Check `~/.skill-git/cache/<agent>/scans/latest.json`.

**If `latest.json` does not exist:**

```
No scan results found. Running /skill-git:scan first...
```

Execute the full scan workflow inline (same logic as `scan.md` Steps 0–7, using `agent` and no skill filters). If scan finds no ★★★ or ★★☆ pairs, display the scan report and stop:
```
No merge candidates found. All pairs are below 30% overlap.
```

**If `latest.json` exists:**

Check staleness: for each skill in `latest.json["target_skills"]`, run:
```bash
git -C <skill_path> rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null
```
Compare against `latest.json["skill_versions"][<skill>]["commit_sha"]`. If any SHA has changed:
```
⚠️  Scan results may be stale — the following skills have changed since the last scan:
    - <skill-name>  (last scanned: v1.0.1, current: v1.0.2)

Use stale results anyway? (y/n)  Or run /skill-git:scan -f to refresh.
```
Wait for user response. If `n`, stop.

**Select a pair:**

Display ★★★ and ★★☆ pairs from `latest.json["pairs"]` only. If none exist:
```
No merge candidates found (all pairs below 30% overlap).
Run /skill-git:scan to re-analyze, or specify skills directly:
  /skill-git:merge <skill-a> <skill-b>
```
Stop.

```
Last scan: <scanned_at>  (<N> skills, <M> pairs analyzed)

<insight from latest.json["insight"]>

Select a pair to merge:
  [1] ★★★  code-style + code-review     68%  → recommend merge
  [2] ★★☆  testing + tdd                41%  → merge with caution

Enter a number (or "q" to quit):
```

Wait for user input. If `q`, stop. Set `merge_targets` to the two skills of the chosen pair.

---

## Step 3 — Load Topics

**If `merge_targets` came from scan results** (`latest.json`):

Look up the matching pair in `latest.json["pairs"]`. Resolve the full topic objects for `shared_topic_ids`, `conflict_topic_ids`, and `unmatched_topic_ids` from `latest.json["topics"]`.

**If `merge_targets` were specified directly as arguments:**

For each skill in `merge_targets`, check rule cache at `~/.skill-git/cache/<agent>/rules/<skill-name>.json`:
- If cache exists and `commit_sha` matches `git -C <skill_path> rev-parse --short HEAD` → use cached rules
- Otherwise → read all files in the skill folder (`SKILL.md`, other `*.md`, scripts) and extract rules directly (same methodology as `scan` Phase 1)

Then run global clustering across all skills in `merge_targets` (same methodology as `scan` Phase 2 steps 5a–5b) to produce:
- `topics`: list of rule topics with entries
- Per pair: `shared_topics`, `conflict_topics`, `unmatched` topics

**After loading, display:**

```
Merging: <skill-a> + <skill-b>

  <N> shared topics        → will appear once in merged skill
  <N> unique to <skill-a>  → will be added
  <N> unique to <skill-b>  → will be added
  <N> conflicting topics   → need your decision
```

If there are 0 conflicting topics, note: `No conflicts — ready to synthesize.`

---

## Step 4 — Interactive Conflict Resolution

Skip this step entirely if there are 0 conflicting topics.

For each conflicting topic, present it and wait for user response before moving to the next:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Conflict 1 of N: <topic label>

  Why: <one-sentence plain-language explanation of why these rules conflict
       and what practical difference choosing one over the other makes>

  [1] <skill-a>:<line>   "<rule text from skill-a>"
  [2] <skill-b>:<line>   "<rule text from skill-b>"
  [3] Write a custom rule
  [4] Keep both (include both, mark as TODO)

Your choice:
```

The `Why:` line is mandatory — never omit it. It should explain the semantic difference in plain language (e.g. "skill-a gates changes with a scoring threshold; skill-b promotes based on recurrence count — different decision frameworks for when to act on a learning").

If the topic has entries from 3+ skills, list all entries as `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` … with custom and keep-both as the last two options.

Record each decision:
- `1` / `2` / `3` … → keep that entry verbatim
- Custom → prompt `Enter your custom rule:` and record the text
- Keep both → mark `keep_both: true`; all entries will be included with `<!-- TODO: resolve conflict -->` between them

After all conflicts are resolved:
```
All conflicts resolved. ✅
```

---

## Step 5 — Choose Merge Output

Ask both questions before proceeding.

**5a. Name:**
```
Name for the merged skill?
Suggestion: <short name derived from shared topic labels>
(press Enter to accept, or type a new name)
```

If the name already exists as a folder under `<global_base>/skills/`, warn:
```
⚠️  "<name>" already exists.
  [1] Overwrite <name>
  [2] Enter a different name
```

**5b. Base folder:**
```
Which folder to use as the base?
  [1] <skill-a>   <path>  (reuses existing git history)
  [2] <skill-b>   <path>  (reuses existing git history)
  [3] New folder: <global_base>/skills/<merged-name>/

Your choice:
```

Choosing `[1]` or `[2]` writes the merged SKILL.md into that folder, preserving its git history. The folder name stays unchanged; only the `name` field in frontmatter updates to `<merged-name>`.

---

## Step 6 — Synthesize Merged SKILL.md

Generate the merged skill content:

```markdown
---
name: <merged name>
description: <synthesized description covering the full scope of merged skills>
version: 1.0.0
---

# <Merged Name>

<1–2 sentence introduction explaining what this skill covers>

## <Topic heading>

<rule text>

## <Topic heading>

<rule text>
```

**Synthesis rules:**
- **Shared topics**: write one best-worded rule — synthesize if both entries add nuance, otherwise pick the clearer one. Never duplicate.
- **Unique topics**: include verbatim. Integrate logically by topic; do not add section labels like "From code-style".
- **Resolved conflicts**: use the chosen text. For `keep_both`, include all entries with `<!-- TODO: resolve conflict -->` between them.
- **Non-SKILL.md files**: do not auto-merge. Append a note comment at the end of the file:
  ```
  <!-- Files to review (not auto-merged):
       <skill-a>: run.sh
       <skill-b>: examples.md, run.sh
  -->
  ```

Display the full draft:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Draft: <merged-name>

<full SKILL.md content>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Approve this draft?
  [y] Yes, write it
  [e] Edit — tell me what to change
  [q] Quit without saving
```

If `[e]`: apply revision instructions, regenerate, show again. Repeat until `[y]` or `[q]`.
If `[q]`: stop. No files are written. config.json is unchanged.

---

## Step 7 — Write Files

Only execute after the user chooses `[y]` in Step 6.

**7a. Write SKILL.md:**

```bash
# base is an existing folder (choice [1] or [2]):
cat > <base_skill_path>/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
<merged content>
EOF

# new folder (choice [3]):
mkdir -p <global_base>/skills/<merged-name>
cat > <global_base>/skills/<merged-name>/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
<merged content>
EOF
git -C <global_base>/skills/<merged-name> init
```

**7b. Handle non-SKILL.md files:**

First, enumerate all non-SKILL.md, non-.git files and directories in each source skill folder:

```bash
find <skill-path> -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -name '.git' -not -name 'SKILL.md' \
  -mindepth 1 | sort
```

**Before copying, apply these filters:**

0. **Sensitive filename blocklist — never copy regardless of user consent.**
   Skip any file whose name or path component matches (case-insensitive):
   ```
   .env  .env.*  *.env
   *.pem  *.key  *.p12  *.pfx  *.crt  *.cer  *.keystore
   credentials  credentials.*  credential.*
   secrets  secrets.*  secret.*
   *_token  *_token.*  *.token
   *password*  *passwd*  *secret*  *apikey*  *api_key*
   .aws  .ssh  id_rsa  id_ed25519  id_ecdsa
   *.gpg  *.pgp
   ```
   List any blocked files in the final Output Summary under a `Skipped (sensitive filename)` line.

1. **`_meta.json` — never copy; always regenerate.**
   If `_meta.json` exists in any source skill, skip it from the copy step. Instead, after writing SKILL.md, generate a fresh `_meta.json` for the merged skill:
   ```json
   {
     "ownerId": "<ownerId from the base skill, or whichever source the user chose as [1]/[2]; omit if base is [3] and both differ>",
     "slug": "<merged-name>",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "publishedAt": <current unix timestamp in milliseconds>
   }
   ```
   If base is `[3]` (new folder) and both sources have different `ownerId` values, ask:
   ```
   Which ownerId to use for the merged skill's _meta.json?
     [1] <skill-a> ownerId: <value>
     [2] <skill-b> ownerId: <value>
     [3] Omit ownerId (unpublished)
   ```

2. **Backup/draft files — skip and report.**
   Do not copy files matching these patterns (they are source-skill history artifacts):
   - `SKILL-v*.md`
   - `*-backup.*`, `*-draft.*`, `*.bak`

   List any skipped files in the final Output Summary under a `Skipped (source artifacts)` line.

3. **Identical file conflict — skip prompt silently.**
   When a file exists in both sources (conflict candidate), first check if the contents are identical:
   ```bash
   cmp -s <file-from-skill-a> <file-from-skill-b>
   ```
   If identical → keep base version silently, no prompt shown. Track in an `auto-merged (identical)` list for the summary.
   If different → show the conflict prompt as normal.

**Case A — base is an existing skill folder ([1] or [2]):**

All files already in the base folder are preserved automatically. Only files from the other source skill(s) need attention.

For each non-base source skill, list its non-SKILL.md contents. If any exist:

```
Files in <other-skill> (not in base):
  scripts/run.sh
  assets/LEARNINGS.md
  hooks/handler.js
  references/examples.md
  ...

These will be copied into <merged-skill-path>/. Files that already exist in the base will be shown for your decision.
Copy them now? (y/n)
```

Default is `y`. If `y`:
- For each file/directory unique to the other skill: copy preserving structure
  ```bash
  cp -r <other-skill-path>/<item> <merged-skill-path>/
  ```
- For each file that already exists in the base folder: show a conflict prompt:
  ```
  ⚠️  Conflict: <filename> exists in both <base-skill> and <other-skill>
    [1] Keep base (<base-skill> version)
    [2] Use other (<other-skill> version)
    [3] Keep both: rename other to <filename>.<other-skill>
  ```
  Wait for user choice and act accordingly.

**Case B — base is a new folder ([3]):**

Both source skills' files must be copied. Enumerate all non-SKILL.md, non-.git contents from both:

```
Files to copy into <merged-skill-path>/:

  From <skill-a>:
    scripts/run.sh
    assets/LEARNINGS.md
    .gitignore

  From <skill-b>:
    hooks/handler.js
    references/examples.md
    scripts/run.sh          ← also exists in <skill-a>

Copy all files now? (y/n)
```

Default is `y`. If `y`:
1. Copy all files from skill-a first:
   ```bash
   find <skill-a-path> -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -name '.git' -not -name 'SKILL.md' \
     -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 | xargs -I{} cp -r {} <merged-skill-path>/
   ```
2. For each item from skill-b: if no conflict, copy directly. If a file or directory already exists from skill-a, show conflict prompt:
   ```
   ⚠️  Conflict: <filename> exists in both <skill-a> and <skill-b>
     [1] Keep <skill-a> version
     [2] Use <skill-b> version
     [3] Keep both: rename <skill-b> copy to <filename>.<skill-b>
   ```
   Wait for user choice and act accordingly.

If no non-SKILL.md files exist in any source skill, skip this sub-step silently.

**7c. Update config.json:**

Add the merged skill entry (if new folder) or update the existing entry version. Source skills that will be deleted are removed in step 7d.

```bash
jq --arg agent "<agent>" \
   --arg name "<merged-name>" \
   --arg path "<merged-skill-path>" \
   --arg version "v1.0.0" \
   '.agents[$agent].skills[$name] = {"path": $path, "version": $version}' \
   ~/.skill-git/config.json > /tmp/sg-cfg.json \
   && mv /tmp/sg-cfg.json ~/.skill-git/config.json
```

**7d. Delete source skill folders:**

If base was `[3]` (new folder), both source folders still exist. Ask:
```
Delete source skills now that they have been merged?
  <skill-a>  <path>
  <skill-b>  <path>

  [y] Yes, delete both
  [n] No, keep them (you can delete manually later)
```

If base was `[1]` or `[2]`, only the other source still exists. Ask:
```
Delete <other-skill> now that it has been merged into <merged-name>?
  <other-skill>  <path>

  [y] Yes, delete it
  [n] No, keep it
```

Before deleting any folder, check for uncommitted changes:
```bash
git -C <skill-path> status --porcelain
```
If output is non-empty, warn:
```
⚠️  <skill-name> has uncommitted changes. Delete anyway? (y/n)
```

If confirmed, delete and remove from config.json:
```bash
rm -rf <skill-path>

jq --arg agent "<agent>" --arg name "<skill-name>" \
   'del(.agents[$agent].skills[$name])' \
   ~/.skill-git/config.json > /tmp/sg-cfg.json \
   && mv /tmp/sg-cfg.json ~/.skill-git/config.json
```

---

## Step 8 — Commit

Commit the merged skill using the same logic as `commit.md` Steps 4–5:

1. Determine version:
   - New folder (base `[3]`): `v1.0.0`
   - Reusing existing folder: run `git -C <path> describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null`, increment MINOR (e.g. `v1.0.2` → `v1.1.0`)

2. Generate commit message: `merge <skill-a> and <skill-b> into <merged-name>`

3. Run a pre-flight check — verify each prior step completed successfully:
   - SKILL.md exists at `<merged-skill-path>/SKILL.md`
   - `config.json` contains an entry for `<merged-name>`
   - Source skill folders are in expected state (deleted or still present per user choice)

   Then show the confirmation. **This prompt is mandatory and must not be skipped.**
   ```
   ⚠️  This will create a permanent git commit and version tag.

     Pre-flight:
       ✅ SKILL.md written to <merged-skill-path>
       ✅ config.json updated
       ✅ Source skills: <deleted / kept as chosen>
       [❌ <describe any failed check — stop and report if any ❌ present>]

     Ready to commit:
       <merged-name>  <current> → <new-version>
       "merge <skill-a> and <skill-b> into <merged-name>"

   Proceed? (y/n)
   ```

   If any pre-flight item shows ❌, do not commit. Report what's missing and stop.

4. Execute:
   ```bash
   git -c user.email=skill-git@local -c user.name=skill-git \
     -C <merged-skill-path> add -A
   git -c user.email=skill-git@local -c user.name=skill-git \
     -C <merged-skill-path> commit -m "<message>"
   git -c user.email=skill-git@local -c user.name=skill-git \
     -C <merged-skill-path> tag <new-version>
   ```

   If any command fails, show the git error and stop.

5. Update config.json with the new version:
   ```bash
   jq --arg agent "<agent>" --arg name "<merged-name>" --arg ver "<new-version>" \
     '.agents[$agent].skills[$name].version = $ver' \
     ~/.skill-git/config.json > /tmp/sg-cfg.json \
     && mv /tmp/sg-cfg.json ~/.skill-git/config.json
   ```
