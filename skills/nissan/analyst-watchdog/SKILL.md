# Analyst Watchdog

An autonomous monitoring agent pattern: watch a system, detect changes, write findings, alert when thresholds are crossed. Runs on a schedule (LaunchAgent or cron) without human intervention.

## Pattern

```
API Endpoint → Poll → Detect Changes → Write FINDINGS.md
                                      → Write OUTBOX.md (for orchestrator)
                                      → Write ALERT_TELEGRAM.md (urgent)
```

## What It Monitors

Configurable, but the reference implementation tracks:
- Model evaluation scores hitting milestones (n=50, 100, 150, 200)
- Promotion events (model proven equivalent to cloud baseline)
- Score anomalies (sudden drops or improvements)
- System health degradation

## Alert Tiers

| File | Urgency | Who Reads It |
|---|---|---|
| `FINDINGS.md` | Low | Background knowledge |
| `OUTBOX.md` | Medium | Orchestrator on next heartbeat |
| `ALERT_TELEGRAM.md` | High | Sent immediately, then deleted |
