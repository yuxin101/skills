# Buffer Publisher

## When to Use This / When NOT to Use This

**Use Buffer when:**
- Publishing a post to LinkedIn (`nissandookeran`) or Twitter/X (`redditech`) — immediately or scheduled
- Queuing a post for Buffer's automatic optimal-time slot
- Any social publishing task from Liv or the content pipeline

**Do NOT use Buffer for:**
- Bluesky — not connected, no tool available yet
- Drafting content — Buffer publishes, it doesn't draft. Write content first, then call this skill.
- Reading/analytics — Buffer GraphQL can query posts but that's out of scope here; check Buffer dashboard directly
- Any platform other than LinkedIn and Twitter/X

> **Only tool available:** Typefully was cancelled 2026-03-25. Buffer is the single social publishing surface. There is no fallback.

## Connected Channels
| Channel | ID | Service |
|---|---|---|

## Publish Immediately (shareNow)

```python
import json, subprocess

BUFFER_KEY = "<key from 1Password>"
CHANNEL_ID = "69c29382af47dacb694d24b4"  # LinkedIn
# or  "69c29939af47dacb694d3d1f"  # Twitter/X

payload = {
    "query": """mutation CreatePost($input: CreatePostInput!) { 
        createPost(input: $input) { 
            ... on PostActionSuccess { post { id status } } 
        } 
    }""",
    "variables": {
        "input": {
            "channelId": CHANNEL_ID,
            "text": "Your post text here",
            "schedulingType": "automatic",
            "mode": "shareNow"
        }
    }
}

result = subprocess.run(
    ["curl", "-s", "-X", "POST",
     "-H", f"Authorization: Bearer {BUFFER_KEY}",
     "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
     "-d", json.dumps(payload),
     "https://api.buffer.com/graphql"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
d = json.loads(result.stdout)
post_id = d["data"]["createPost"]["post"]["id"]
status = d["data"]["createPost"]["post"]["status"]
print(f"Post ID: {post_id}, Status: {status}")
# status "sent" = published immediately
```

---

## Schedule a Post for a Specific Time

Use `mode: "customScheduled"` + a `dueAt` ISO8601 UTC timestamp. **Do NOT use `scheduledAt`** — that field does not exist on the Post type.

```python
import json, subprocess
from datetime import datetime, timezone

BUFFER_KEY = "<key from 1Password>"
CHANNEL_ID = "69c29382af47dacb694d24b4"  # LinkedIn

# Schedule for 9am Sydney time (UTC+11 in AEDT) = 22:00 UTC prior day
# Always convert to UTC before passing to Buffer
scheduled_utc = "2026-03-27T22:00:00Z"  # ISO8601 UTC — the Z suffix is required

payload = {
    "query": """mutation CreatePost($input: CreatePostInput!) { 
        createPost(input: $input) { 
            ... on PostActionSuccess { post { id status dueAt } } 
        } 
    }""",
    "variables": {
        "input": {
            "channelId": CHANNEL_ID,
            "text": "Your scheduled post text here",
            "schedulingType": "automatic",
            "mode": "customScheduled",
            "dueAt": scheduled_utc
        }
    }
}

result = subprocess.run(
    ["curl", "-s", "-X", "POST",
     "-H", f"Authorization: Bearer {BUFFER_KEY}",
     "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
     "-d", json.dumps(payload),
     "https://api.buffer.com/graphql"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
d = json.loads(result.stdout)
post = d["data"]["createPost"]["post"]
print(f"Post ID: {post['id']}, Status: {post['status']}, Due: {post['dueAt']}")
# status "buffer" = queued/scheduled (not yet sent)
```

---

## What Success Looks Like

A successful `createPost` response body looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPost": {
      "post": {
        "id": "67e3a1b2c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1",
        "status": "sent"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `status: "sent"` → published immediately (shareNow)
- `status: "buffer"` → queued or scheduled (will publish at `dueAt`)
- If `data.createPost` is `null` or missing `post`, the mutation failed silently — check for a top-level `errors` array

**Failure response example:**
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Value \"shareNOW\" does not exist in \"SchedulingType\" enum.",
      "locations": [{"line": 1, "column": 42}]
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

---

## Key Schema Notes
- `schedulingType` enum: `automatic` | `notification` (NOT "now", NOT "shareNow")
- `mode` enum: `addToQueue` | `shareNow` | `shareNext` | `customScheduled` | `recommendedTime`
- Use `automatic` + `shareNow` for immediate publish
- Use `automatic` + `customScheduled` + `dueAt` for scheduled posts
- `dueAt` field takes ISO8601 UTC datetime string (NOT `scheduledAt` — that field doesn't exist on Post type)
- Response type is a union — always use `... on PostActionSuccess` fragment
- `CoreApiError` does NOT exist in schema — omit error fragment or use other error types
- No `draft` field in `CreatePostInput` — omit it

## Get Connected Channels
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUFFER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ account { id name email channels { id name service } } }"}' \
  https://api.buffer.com/graphql
```

## Twitter/X Threads via Buffer
Buffer does not support native thread composition. Post as a single update with tweets separated by `\n\n---\n\n`. If true threading is ever needed, evaluate alternative tools at that point.

## Routing Rules
| Platform | Tool |
|---|---|
| LinkedIn | **Buffer** ✅ |
| Twitter/X | **Buffer** ✅ |
| Bluesky | Not connected — skip unless new tool added |

> Typefully cancelled 2026-03-25. No backup — Buffer is the only social publishing tool.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong enum value for `schedulingType`**
   - ❌ `"schedulingType": "now"` → enum error
   - ❌ `"schedulingType": "shareNow"` → enum error (`shareNow` is a `mode` value, not a `schedulingType`)
   - ✅ `"schedulingType": "automatic"` (almost always what you want)

2. **Using `scheduledAt` instead of `dueAt`**
   - ❌ `"scheduledAt": "2026-03-27T22:00:00Z"` → field does not exist, silently ignored or errors
   - ✅ `"dueAt": "2026-03-27T22:00:00Z"`

3. **Forgetting `Content-Type: application/json`**
   - Returns `"Unsupported Content-Type"` error
   - Always include `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` in curl calls

4. **Using the legacy v1 API base URL**
   - ❌ `https://api.bufferapp.com/1/` → returns 500, dead endpoint
   - ✅ `https://api.buffer.com/graphql`

5. **Including `CoreApiError` in the error fragment**
   - This type does not exist in the schema. Omit it or you'll get a schema validation error.

6. **Including `"draft": true` in CreatePostInput**
   - This field doesn't exist. Buffer has no draft state via API — posts are either queued or live.

7. **Timezone confusion with `dueAt`**
   - Buffer expects UTC. Nissan is AEDT (UTC+11). Always convert: 9am Sydney = 10pm UTC prior day.

## Troubleshooting
- `"Unsupported Content-Type"` → must use `Content-Type: application/json`
- `500 from bufferapp.com` → legacy v1 API is dead, use `api.buffer.com/graphql`
- `"Value X does not exist in enum"` → check enum values via introspection: `{ __type(name: "SchedulingType") { enumValues { name } } }`
