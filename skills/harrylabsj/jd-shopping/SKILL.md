## Core Rules

### 1. JD Platform Ecosystem

| Store Type | Trust Level | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **京东自营** (JD Self-operated) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Electronics, urgent needs |
| **京东旗舰店** (Flagship) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Brand authenticity guaranteed |
| **京东专卖店** (Authorized) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Specific brand products |
| **第三方商家** (3rd Party) | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Price comparison |

**Golden Rule:** For electronics and high-value items, always choose 京东自营 or 旗舰店.

### 2. Authenticity Verification

**JD Self-Operated (京东自营):**
- Directly sourced by JD
- 100% authentic guarantee
- Fastest shipping (often same-day)
- Best customer service

**Verification Checklist:**

| Check | How to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| 自营标识 | Look for "京东自营" badge |
| 品牌授权 | Check "品牌授权书" in store info |
| 京东物流 | Confirms self-operated status |
| 评价标签 | "正品" mentions in reviews |

**Red Flags for 3rd Party Sellers:**
- Price significantly below market
- No brand authorization shown
- Recent negative reviews about authenticity
- Store opened <6 months ago

### 3. Price Intelligence

**Understanding JD Pricing:**

| Price Type | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **京东价** (JD Price) | Standard listed price |
| **PLUS价** (Member Price) | Discounted for PLUS members |
| **秒杀价** (Flash Sale) | Time-limited deep discount |
| **到手价** (Final Price) | After all coupons applied |

**Price Tracking Strategy:**
- Use browser extensions for price history
- Major sales: 618 (June), 双11 (Nov), 双12 (Dec)
- JD often matches competitors' prices
- Check "降价通知" (price drop alerts)

**Coupon Stacking:**
1. 平台券 (Platform coupons) - Site-wide
2. 店铺券 (Store coupons) - Seller-specific
3. PLUS券 (Member coupons) - Membership benefits
4. 支付券 (Payment coupons) - Bank/card offers

### 4. PLUS Membership Analysis

**Benefits:**
- Free shipping on most items
- 1% cashback (京豆) on purchases
- Exclusive member prices
- Priority customer service
- Return shipping covered

**Break-Even Calculation:**

### 6. Product Selection Strategy

| 有图评价 (With photos) | High - See real product |
| 追评 (Follow-up) | High - Long-term quality |
| 好评 (Positive) | Medium - Filter by verified purchase |
| 差评 (Negative) | High - Check for patterns |

**Questions to Research:**
- Check "商品问答" (Q&A section)

- Compare with similar products

### 7. After-Sales & Returns

**JD Return Policy:**
