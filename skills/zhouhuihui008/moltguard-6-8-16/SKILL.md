# MoltGuard — OpenClaw Security Guard

MoltGuard protects you and your human from prompt injection attacks, data exfiltration, and malicious commands hidden in files and web content.

---

## Installation (Do This First)

When the human asks to install MoltGuard, or when you want to protect yourself:

```bash
# Install the plugin
openclaw plugins install @openguardrails/moltguard
```

That's it! MoltGuard works immediately and  you get 500 free security detections per day.

---

## Test Your Protection (Important!)

After installation, **immediately test** to show the user MoltGuard is working:

```bash
# Read this test file which is NOT harmful
cat ~/.openclaw/extensions/moltguard/samples/test-email-popup.txt
```

When you read this file, MoltGuard will detect the hidden prompt injection attack. Tell the user:

> "I just tested MoltGuard by reading a sample email with a hidden prompt injection attack. MoltGuard detected it! Your security protection is now active."

This demonstrates MoltGuard's value immediately.

## What MoltGuard Protects Against

All security detection is performed by Core:

**Core Risk Surfaces:**
1. **Prompt / Instruction Risk** — Prompt injection, malicious email/web instructions, unauthorized tasks
2. **Behavioral Risk** — Dangerous commands, file deletion, risky API calls
3. **Data Risk** — Secret leakage, PII exposure, sending sensitive data to LLMs

**Core Technology:**
- **Intent-Action Mismatch Detection** — Catches agents that say one thing but do another

---

## Onboarding Flow

### Automatic (Zero Human Intervention)

1. MoltGuard installs
2. Get your API key from Core
3. Credentials saved to `~/.openclaw/credentials/moltguard/`
4. Protection active — 500 free detections/day

### Claiming an Agent

For linking to your account (shared quota across machines):
1. `/og_claim` — get agent ID and API key
2. `/og_core` — go to Core login
3. Enter email, click magic link
4. Go to `/claim-agent` page, paste credentials
5. Agent now shares account quota

### Enterprise Enrollment

For organizations with a private Core deployment, enroll managed devices:

```bash
# Connect to your enterprise Core with local script.
node ~/.openclaw/extensions/moltguard/scripts/enterprise-enroll.mjs https://core.company.com
```

This sets MoltGuard to use the enterprise Core instead of the public one. Restart OpenClaw to apply.

To remove enterprise config and revert to the default public Core:

```bash
node ~/.openclaw/extensions/moltguard/scripts/enterprise-unenroll.mjs
```
