- **Unified account**: When margin_mode is classic/cross_margin/portfolio, spot may be merged into "trading account". Do NOT use internal terms like "advanced mode", "S1/S2".
- **Pair format**: Futures use no-slash (BTCUSDT); spot/margin use slash (BTC/USDT).
- **Precision**: Fiat valuation 2 decimals; dust (<$0.01) show as `<$0.01`; finance yesterday PnL up to 8 decimals.

## Acceptance Test Queries (Validation)

| Scenario | Query |
|----------|-------|
| Total balance – normal | How much do I have? |
| Total balance – overview | Show my CEX total assets |
| Total balance – small (<10U) | My account asset distribution |
| Specific currency – normal | How many BTC do I have? |
| Specific currency – zero | How much DOGE do I have? |
| Specific account+currency | How much USDT in my spot account? |
| Spot account | What's in my spot account? |
| Futures – with assets | How much in futures account |
| Futures – USDT+BTC perpetual | Show my perpetual contract assets |
| Futures – no assets | Show my USDT perpetual assets |
| Trading account | How much in trading account |
| Options | Show my options assets |
| Alpha | How much in Alpha account |
| Isolated margin | Show my isolated margin assets |
| TradFi | How much in TradFi account |

## Cross-Skill Workflows

- **Before trading**: User asks "Can I buy 100U BTC?" → This skill: `cex_spot_get_spot_accounts` currency=USDT → Route to `gate-exchange-spot` if sufficient.
- **After transfer**: Route to this skill for updated balance when user asks.
- **Transfer card**: When futures/options = 0, recommend [Transfer] and trigger transfer skill.

## Safety Rules

- **Read-only only**. Never call create_order, cancel_order, create_transfer, or any write operation.
- If user intent includes trading, transfer, or order placement → route to appropriate skill.
- Always clarify currency and scope (spot vs all wallets) when ambiguous.
