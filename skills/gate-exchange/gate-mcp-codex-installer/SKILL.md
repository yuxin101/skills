# Gate One-Click Installer (Codex: MCP + Skills)

## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md)
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

## MCP Dependencies

### Required MCP Servers
| MCP Server | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Gate (main) | ✅ Required |
| Gate-Dex | ✅ Required |
| Gate-Info | ✅ Required |
| Gate-News | ✅ Required |

### Authentication
- API Key Required: No

### Installation Check
- Required: Gate (main), Gate-Dex, Gate-Info, Gate-News
- Install: Run installer skill for your IDE
  - Cursor: `gate-mcp-cursor-installer`
  - Codex: `gate-mcp-codex-installer`
  - Claude: `gate-mcp-claude-installer`
  - OpenClaw: `gate-mcp-openclaw-installer`

## CEX MCP modes

See [gate-mcp](https://github.com/gate/gate-mcp): **Local** = stdio `gate-mcp` with API keys; **Remote Public** = `https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp` (no auth); **Remote Exchange** = `https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp/exchange` (Gate OAuth2). Dex/Info/News are separate endpoints on the same host.

## Resources

| Type | Name | Endpoint / Config |
|------|------|-------------------|
| MCP | **Gate** (`main`) | stdio `command = "npx"`, `args = ["-y", "gate-mcp"]`, optional `env` for keys |
| MCP | **gate-cex-pub** (`cex-public`) | `url = "https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp"` |
| MCP | **gate-cex-ex** (`cex-exchange`) | `url = "https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp/exchange"` (OAuth2 in client) |
| MCP | **gate-dex** (`dex`) | `https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp/dex`, `http_headers` x-api-key + Bearer token |
| MCP | **gate-info** (`info`) | `https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp/info` |
| MCP | **gate-news** (`news`) | `https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp/news` |
| Skills | gate-skills | https://github.com/gate/gate-skills (installs all under `skills/`) |

## Behavior Rules

1. **Default**: When the user does not specify which MCPs to install, install **all MCPs** (`main`, `cex-public`, `cex-exchange`, `dex`, `info`, `news`) + **all gate-skills**.
2. **Selectable MCPs**: Users can choose to install only specific MCPs; follow the user's selection.
3. **Skills**: Unless `--no-skills` is passed, always install **all** skills from the gate-skills repository's **skills/** directory.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Confirm User Selection (MCPs)

- If the user does not specify which MCPs → install all: `main`, `cex-public`, `cex-exchange`, `dex`, `info`, `news`.
- If the user specifies "only install xxx" → install only the specified MCPs.

### 2. Write Codex MCP Config

- User-level config: `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`). Creates the file and writes `[mcp_servers]` with corresponding tables if it does not exist.
- If it already exists, **merge**: only append Gate MCP sections that don't already exist; do not overwrite existing config.
- Config details:
  - **Gate (main)**: stdio, `command` / `args` / optional `env` for `GATE_API_KEY` / `GATE_API_SECRET`
  - **gate-cex-pub / gate-cex-ex**: `url` as above (no `http_headers` for remote CEX)
  - **gate-dex**: `url` + `http_headers` for x-api-key and Bearer
  - **gate-info / gate-news**: `url`

### 3. Install gate-skills (all)

- Pull all subdirectories under **skills/** from https://github.com/gate/gate-skills and copy them to `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` (default `~/.codex/skills/`).
- Add `--no-skills` when using the script to install MCP only without skills.

### 4. Post-Installation Prompt

- Inform the user of the installed MCP list and "all gate-skills have been installed" (unless --no-skills was used).
- Prompt to restart Codex to load MCP servers and skills.
- **Local API Key**: For **Gate (main)** trading via API keys → https://www.gate.com/myaccount/profile/api-key/manage
- **gate-cex-ex**: Complete **Gate OAuth2** when Codex prompts on first use.
- **Gate-Dex**: If auth required, open https://web3.gate.com/ for wallet, then complete OAuth via the assistant link.

## Script

Use the **scripts/install.sh** in this skill directory for one-click installation.

- Usage:  
  `./scripts/install.sh [--mcp main|cex-public|cex-exchange|dex|info|news] ... [--no-skills]`  
  Installs all MCPs when no `--mcp` is passed; pass multiple `--mcp` to install only specified ones; `--no-skills` installs MCP only.
- The DEX x-api-key is fixed as `MCP_AK_8W2N7Q` and written to config.toml.

After downloading this skill from GitHub, run from the repository root:  
`bash skills/gate-mcp-codex-installer/scripts/install.sh`  
Or (MCP only):  
`bash skills/gate-mcp-codex-installer/scripts/install.sh --no-skills`
