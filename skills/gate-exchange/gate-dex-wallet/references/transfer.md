# Gate DEX Transfer

> Transfer module — gas estimation, transaction preview, balance verification, signing, and broadcasting. Includes mandatory user confirmation gates. 4 MCP tools + 1 cross-skill call.

## Applicable Scenarios

Use when the user wants to:
- Send or transfer tokens to an on-chain address: "send ETH to 0x...", "transfer USDT", "pay someone"
- Execute batch transfers to multiple recipients: "send to these 3 addresses"
- Transfer native tokens (ETH, BNB, SOL) or token standards (ERC20, SPL)
- Move assets between their own wallets: "move my USDT to my other address"
- Another skill routes the user here for transfer operations

## Capability Boundaries

- **Supports**: Native token transfers, ERC20 transfers, SPL token transfers, batch transfers
- **Supported chains**: eth, bsc, polygon, arbitrum, optimism, avax, base, sol
- **Does not support**: Swap/exchange (-> `gate-dex-trade`), DApp contract calls (-> [dapp.md](./dapp.md)), x402 payment (-> [x402.md](./x402.md)), market data (-> `gate-dex-market`)

**Prerequisites**: MCP Server available (see parent SKILL.md). All operations require a valid `mcp_token`. If missing or expired, route to [auth.md](./auth.md).

---

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `dex_wallet_get_token_list` | Balance verification (cross-skill) | `account_id`, `chain`, `mcp_token` |
| `dex_tx_gas` | Estimate gas fee | `chain`, `from_address`, `to_address`, `value?`, `data?`, `mcp_token` |
| `dex_tx_transfer_preview` | Build unsigned tx + confirmation message | `chain`, `from_address`, `to_address`, `token_address`, `amount`, `account_id`, `mcp_token` |
| `dex_wallet_sign_transaction` | Server-side signing (user must confirm first) | `raw_tx`, `chain`, `account_id`, `mcp_token` |
| `dex_tx_send_raw_transaction` | Broadcast signed tx | `signed_tx`, `chain`, `mcp_token` |

### Tool Details

#### `dex_wallet_get_token_list` (Cross-Skill) — Query Balance

Called before every transfer to verify the sending token balance and gas token balance.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Parameters** | `{ account_id: string, chain: string, mcp_token: string }` |
| **Returns** | Token array with `symbol`, `balance`, `price`, `value`, `chain`, `contract_address` |

#### `dex_tx_gas` — Estimate Gas Fees

Estimates gas for a transaction on the specified chain.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Parameters** | `{ chain, from_address, to_address, value?, data?, mcp_token }` |
| **Returns** | `{ gas_limit, gas_price, estimated_fee, fee_usd }` |

- For native token transfers: pass the `value` in wei/lamports.
- For ERC20 transfers: set `value` to `"0"` and provide `data` (transfer calldata).
- Solana gas structure differs (fee in lamports); handle according to actual returns.

#### `dex_tx_transfer_preview` — Build Transaction Preview

Builds an unsigned transaction and returns a confirmation summary including server-side `confirm_message`.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Parameters** | `{ chain, from_address, to_address, token_address, amount, account_id, mcp_token }` |
| **Returns** | `{ raw_tx, confirm_message, estimated_gas, nonce }` |

- `token_address`: Use `"native"` for native tokens.
- `amount`: Human-readable format (e.g., `"1.5"`, not wei).

**CRITICAL**: After receiving `raw_tx`, do **not** sign directly. Display the confirmation summary and wait for explicit user confirmation.

#### `dex_wallet_sign_transaction` — Server-side Signing

Signs an unsigned transaction using server-side custodial keys. **Only call after explicit user confirmation.**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Parameters** | `{ raw_tx, chain, account_id, mcp_token }` |
| **Returns** | `{ signed_tx }` |

#### `dex_tx_send_raw_transaction` — Broadcast

Broadcasts a signed transaction to the on-chain network.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Parameters** | `{ signed_tx, chain, mcp_token }` |
| **Returns** | `{ hash_id }` |

## Tool Call Chain

Complete transfer flow in strict linear sequence:

```
0. dex_chain_config                          <- Session detection (if needed)
1. dex_wallet_get_token_list                 <- Cross-skill: query balance (token + gas)
2. dex_tx_gas                                <- Estimate gas fees
3. [Agent balance validation]                <- Internal logic, not an MCP call
4. dex_tx_transfer_preview                   <- Build unsigned tx + confirmation info
5. [Display confirmation, wait for user]     <- MANDATORY gate, not an MCP call
6. dex_wallet_sign_transaction               <- Sign after user confirms
7. dex_tx_send_raw_transaction               <- Broadcast on-chain
```

---

## Execution Flow

### Flow A: Standard Transfer

```
Step 1: Authentication check
  No mcp_token -> route to auth.md
  |
Step 2: Intent recognition + parameter collection
  Extract: to_address (required), amount (required), token (required), chain (optional)
  If parameters missing, ask the user for each:
  "Please provide: recipient address, transfer amount, token (e.g., ETH, USDT), and chain (optional, default Ethereum)."
  |
Step 3: Get wallet address
  Call dex_wallet_get_addresses({ account_id, mcp_token }) -> extract from_address for target chain
  |
Step 4: Query balance (cross-skill)
  Call dex_wallet_get_token_list({ account_id, chain, mcp_token })
  Extract transfer token balance and native gas token balance
  |
Step 5: Estimate gas
  Call dex_tx_gas({ chain, from_address, to_address, value?, data?, mcp_token })
  |
Step 6: Balance validation (MANDATORY)
  Rules:
  a) Native transfer:  balance >= amount + estimated_fee
  b) ERC20 transfer:   token_balance >= amount AND native_balance >= estimated_fee
  c) SPL transfer:     token_balance >= amount AND sol_balance >= estimated_fee
  Validation failed -> abort and display shortfall details with suggestions
  |
Step 7: Build transaction preview
  Call dex_tx_transfer_preview({ chain, from_address, to_address, token_address, amount, account_id, mcp_token })
  |
Step 8: Display confirmation (MANDATORY GATE)
  Show: chain, type, sender, recipient, amount, balances, gas estimate, server confirm_message
  Wait for explicit "confirm" reply.
  - "confirm" -> proceed to Step 9
  - "cancel"  -> abort, display cancellation notice
  - modification request -> return to Step 2
  |
Step 9: Sign transaction
  Call dex_wallet_sign_transaction({ raw_tx, chain, account_id, mcp_token })
  |
Step 10: Broadcast
  Call dex_tx_send_raw_transaction({ signed_tx, chain, mcp_token }) -> get hash_id
  |
Step 11: Display result + proactive suggestions
  Show tx hash, block explorer link, and post-transfer suggestions (see Post-Transfer Suggestions)
```

### Flow B: Batch Transfer

Each transfer independently goes through Steps 3-8, confirmed one by one:

```
Step 1-2: Auth + collect all transfer intents

Step 3-8: Per transfer (sequential)
  Each transfer gets its own confirmation:
  "confirm" -> Execute this transfer
  "skip"    -> Skip this transfer, continue to next
  "cancel all" -> Abort remaining transfers

Step 9-10: Sign + broadcast confirmed transfers only

Step 11: Summary table + proactive suggestions
  | # | To | Amount | Status | Hash |
  |---|-----|--------|--------|------|
  | 1 | 0xDEF...5678 | 100 USDT | ✅ Success | 0xa1b2... |
  | 2 | 0x123...ABCD | 200 USDT | ⏭ Skipped | — |
```

## Address Validation

| Chain Type | Format | Regex |
|------------|--------|-------|
| EVM (eth/bsc/polygon/...) | `0x` + 40 hex chars (42 total) | `^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$` |
| Solana | Base58, 32-44 chars | `^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32,44}$` |

Validation failure -> Reject transfer with format guidance. Same-address warning -> Confirm intentional operation.

## Conversation Examples

**Example 1 (Happy Path): Successful ETH transfer**
User: "Send 0.5 ETH to 0xDEF...5678"
Agent:
1. Verify auth -> call `dex_wallet_get_addresses` -> get `from_address`.
2. Call `dex_wallet_get_token_list` -> check ETH balance.
3. Call `dex_tx_gas` -> estimate gas fee.
4. Validate: 0.5 + gas <= ETH balance.
5. Call `dex_tx_transfer_preview` -> display confirmation template.
6. User replies "confirm".
7. Call `dex_wallet_sign_transaction` -> call `dex_tx_send_raw_transaction`.
8. Display tx hash + etherscan link + post-transfer suggestions.

**Example 2 (Happy Path): ERC20 transfer with full details**
User: "Send 100 USDT to 0xABC...1234 on Ethereum"
Agent:
1. Verify auth -> get wallet address for ETH chain.
2. Call `dex_wallet_get_token_list({ chain: "eth" })` -> verify USDT balance >= 100 AND ETH balance >= gas fee.
3. Call `dex_tx_gas` -> estimate gas.
4. Call `dex_tx_transfer_preview` -> display ERC20 confirmation template.
5. User replies "confirm".
6. Call `dex_wallet_sign_transaction` -> call `dex_tx_send_raw_transaction`.
7. Display tx hash + explorer link + post-transfer suggestions.

**Example 3 (Happy Path): Solana native transfer**
User: "Send 2 SOL to BTYz...bfxE"
Agent:
1. Verify auth -> get Solana wallet address.
2. Call `dex_wallet_get_token_list({ chain: "sol" })` -> verify SOL balance >= 2 + gas.
3. Call `dex_tx_transfer_preview({ chain: "sol", token_address: "native", amount: "2", ... })`.
4. Display confirmation. On confirm -> sign -> broadcast -> display tx hash + solscan link.

**Example 4 (Happy Path): SPL token transfer (e.g., USDC on Solana)**
User: "Transfer 50 USDC to my friend's Solana address BTYz..."
Agent:
1. Verify auth -> get Solana address.
2. Call `dex_wallet_get_token_list({ chain: "sol" })` -> verify USDC balance >= 50 AND SOL >= gas + ATA rent.
3. Call `dex_tx_transfer_preview` with token mint address.
4. Display confirmation including note about possible ATA creation fee.
5. On confirm -> sign -> broadcast.

**Example 5 (Happy Path): Transfer on L2 (Arbitrum)**
User: "Send 200 USDT to 0xDEF... on Arbitrum"
Agent:
1. Get wallet address (same as ETH — EVM chains share address).
2. Check USDT balance on Arbitrum and ETH balance for gas.
3. Build preview, display confirmation with Arbitrum-specific gas estimate.
4. On confirm -> sign -> broadcast -> display arbiscan link.

**Example 6 (Edge Case): Insufficient token balance**
User: "Transfer 1000 USDT on Ethereum"
Agent:
1. Call `dex_wallet_get_token_list` -> USDT balance is 800.
2. Abort: "Insufficient balance. You have 800 USDT but need 1000 USDT. Please reduce the amount or top up first."
3. Suggest: "You can check your balances on other chains or swap tokens to get more USDT."

**Example 7 (Edge Case): Insufficient gas token**
User: "Send 100 USDT to 0xDEF... on Ethereum"
Agent:
1. Call `dex_wallet_get_token_list` -> USDT balance is 200 (sufficient), ETH balance is 0.0001 (insufficient for gas).
2. Abort: "Insufficient gas. You need approximately 0.003 ETH for gas but only have 0.0001 ETH. Please acquire more ETH for gas fees."

**Example 8 (Edge Case): Missing parameters — vague request**
User: "I want to send some tokens"
Agent:
1. Identify intent: transfer, but missing recipient, amount, and token.
2. Reply: "Please provide: recipient address, transfer amount, and token (e.g., ETH, USDT). Optionally specify the chain (default Ethereum)."

**Example 9 (Edge Case): Missing only the chain**
User: "Send 50 USDT to 0xABC..."
Agent:
1. Chain not specified. Default to Ethereum.
2. Optionally ask: "I'll default to Ethereum. Would you like to send on a different chain (e.g., Arbitrum, BSC)?"

**Example 10 (Edge Case): Invalid address format**
User: "Send 1 ETH to abc123"
Agent:
1. Validate address: "abc123" does not match EVM (`0x` + 40 hex) or Solana (Base58) format.
2. Reject: "Invalid address format. EVM addresses start with 0x and are 42 characters. Solana addresses are 32-44 Base58 characters. Please check and retry."

**Example 11 (Edge Case): Sender == recipient**
User: "Send 1 ETH to 0x... (same as own address)"
Agent:
1. Detect sender and recipient are identical.
2. Warn: "The recipient address is the same as your wallet address. Are you sure you want to proceed? This will only consume gas without moving tokens."

**Example 12 (Edge Case): User cancels confirmation**
User: (After seeing confirmation) "cancel"
Agent:
1. Immediately abort. No signing or broadcasting occurs.
2. Reply: "Transfer cancelled. No transaction was signed or broadcast."

**Example 13 (Edge Case): User modifies parameters after preview**
User: (After seeing confirmation) "Change the amount to 0.3 ETH"
Agent:
1. Return to parameter collection with updated amount.
2. Re-run balance check, gas estimation, and preview with new amount.

**Example 14 (Edge Case): Batch transfer**
User: "Send 100 USDT to 0xAAA..., 200 USDT to 0xBBB..., and 50 USDT to 0xCCC..."
Agent:
1. Parse 3 transfer intents.
2. Process each sequentially with individual confirmations.
3. Display summary table at end.

**Example 15 (Boundary Case): Not this module — swap request**
User: "Swap ETH for USDT"
Agent: This is a swap operation. Route to `gate-dex-trade`.

**Example 16 (Boundary Case): Not this module — DApp interaction**
User: "Connect my wallet to Uniswap"
Agent: This is a DApp interaction. Route to [dapp.md](./dapp.md).

**Example 17 (Boundary Case): Not this module — x402 payment**
User: "Pay for this API endpoint"
Agent: This is an x402 payment. Route to [x402.md](./x402.md).

**Example 18 (Boundary Case): Not this module — balance check only**
User: "How much ETH do I have?"
Agent: This is a balance query, not a transfer. Route to [asset-query.md](./asset-query.md).

---

## Post-Transfer Suggestions

After a successful transfer, **proactively display next actions**. This template is paired with the Follow-up Routing Table below.

**After successful single transfer:**
```
✅ Transfer broadcast successfully!
Tx Hash: {hash_id}
Explorer: https://{explorer}/tx/{hash_id}
Transaction submitted. Confirmation time depends on network congestion.

You can:
- Check your updated balance
- View transaction details on block explorer
- Make another transfer
- Swap tokens on DEX
```

**After successful batch transfer:**
```
✅ Batch transfer complete! {success_count}/{total_count} transfers succeeded.
See the summary table above for individual tx hashes.

You can:
- Check your updated balances
- View details of any specific transaction
- Make additional transfers
- Swap tokens on DEX
```

**After user cancels transfer:**
```
Transfer cancelled. No transaction was signed or broadcast.

You can:
- Start a new transfer with different parameters
- Check your current balances
- Swap tokens instead
```

**After transfer fails (balance insufficient):**
```
Transfer could not proceed due to insufficient balance.

You can:
- Check your balances across all chains
- Swap tokens to acquire the needed asset
- Try a smaller transfer amount
```

### Follow-up Routing Table

| User Follow-up Intent | Target |
|------------------------|--------|
| View updated balance | [asset-query.md](./asset-query.md) (`dex_wallet_get_token_list`) |
| View transaction details / history | [asset-query.md](./asset-query.md) (`dex_tx_detail`, `dex_tx_list`) |
| Continue transferring to other addresses | Stay in this module |
| Swap tokens | `gate-dex-trade` |
| Pay for a 402 resource | [x402.md](./x402.md) |
| Interact with a DApp | [dapp.md](./dapp.md) |
| Login / auth expired | [auth.md](./auth.md) |
| Check token prices | `gate-dex-market` |
| Use CLI commands | [cli.md](./cli.md) |

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Not logged in / `mcp_token` missing | Attempt silent refresh via `dex_auth_refresh_token`; on failure route to [auth.md](./auth.md) |
| Token expired mid-transfer | Attempt silent refresh; on failure route to re-login, preserve transfer intent for retry |
| Transfer token balance insufficient | Abort; show current balance vs. required amount; suggest reducing amount or topping up |
| Gas token balance insufficient | Abort; display gas token shortfall; suggest acquiring gas tokens |
| Invalid recipient address format | Refuse to initiate; show correct format for the target chain |
| Recipient == sender | Warn user; confirm if intentional |
| `dex_tx_gas` estimation failed | Display error; suggest retry later (possible network congestion or contract issue) |
| `dex_tx_transfer_preview` failed | Display server error; do not silently retry |
| `dex_wallet_sign_transaction` failed | Display signing error; do not auto-retry |
| `dex_tx_send_raw_transaction` failed | Display broadcast error (nonce conflict, gas too low, network congestion); suggest action based on error type |
| User cancels confirmation | Immediately abort; do not sign or broadcast |
| Amount is 0 or negative | Refuse to execute; prompt for a valid positive amount |
| Amount exceeds token precision | Prompt precision limit; auto-truncate or ask user to correct |
| Token not available on target chain | Prompt that the token doesn't exist on the target chain; suggest the correct chain |
| Unsupported chain | Show supported chain list from Supported Chains table |
| Broadcast succeeds but tx unconfirmed | Inform user tx submitted; confirmation depends on network |
| Network interruption after signing | Inform signed tx can be broadcast later; do not discard |
| Batch transfer partial failure | Mark failed transfers, continue remaining; show summary at end |

---

## Security Rules

1. **Token confidentiality**: Never display `mcp_token` in plaintext.
2. **Account ID masking**: Show only partial `account_id` characters in user-facing output.
3. **Silent refresh**: Attempt `dex_auth_refresh_token` before routing to re-login.
4. **Mandatory balance validation**: Always validate balance (token + gas) before transfer. Never initiate signing when balance is insufficient.
5. **Mandatory user confirmation**: Before signing, display a complete confirmation summary and get an explicit "confirm" reply. Never skip, simplify, or auto-confirm.
6. **Individual confirmation for batches**: Each transaction in a batch must be confirmed individually.
7. **No auto-retry on failure**: After signing or broadcast failure, display the error clearly. Never auto-retry in the background.
8. **Address validation**: Validate recipient address format before sending to prevent asset loss.
9. **MCP Server required**: Abort all operations if connection detection fails.
10. **Transparent errors**: Display all MCP Server errors truthfully without modification.
11. **Raw tx confidentiality**: `raw_tx` hex data flows only between Agent and MCP Server — never display to users.
12. **Broadcast immediately after signing**: Do not hold signed transactions for extended periods.
