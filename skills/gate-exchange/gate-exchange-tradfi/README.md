# Gate Exchange TradFi Query Skill

## Overview

AI Agent skill for querying Gate TradFi (traditional finance) data in read-only mode. All MCP tools used are prefixed with `cex_tradfi`. It supports four query areas: order list and order history, current and historical positions, market data (category list, symbol list, ticker, symbol kline), and user assets plus MT5 account info. **No order placement, fund transfer, or balance transfer.**

### Core Capabilities

| Module              | Description                                           | Example prompts                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Query orders**    | Order list, order history                             | "My TradFi orders", "Order history"                                  |
| **Query positions** | Current position list, position history               | "My positions", "Position history", "Current holdings"               |
| **Query market**    | Category list, symbol list, ticker, symbol kline      | "TradFi categories", "Symbol list", "Ticker for X", "Kline 1d"       |
| **Query assets**    | User balance/asset info, MT5 account info             | "My assets", "Balance", "MT5 account", "My MT5 info"                 |

## Architecture

This skill uses a **routing architecture**:

- **SKILL.md** defines the four sub-modules, routing rules, MCP tool list (all `cex_tradfi_*`), and execution flow. Intent is mapped to one of the reference documents.
- **references/** holds one document per module:
  - `query-orders.md` — order list, order history
  - `query-positions.md` — current position list, position history
  - `query-market.md` — category list, symbol list, ticker, symbol kline
  - `query-assets.md` — user assets/balance, MT5 account info

Each reference contains a Workflow (steps and tool calls), Report Template, and scenarios with Context, Prompt Examples, and Expected Behavior. The agent loads the matching reference and follows its workflow to call the appropriate `cex_tradfi_*` MCP tools and format the response.

## Prerequisites

- Gate MCP configured and connected with TradFi tools (all prefixed with `cex_tradfi_`, e.g. `cex_tradfi_query_order_list`, `cex_tradfi_query_categories`, `cex_tradfi_query_mt5_account_info`). If your MCP uses different tool names, map them in SKILL.md or in the reference docs.

## Example Prompts

```
# Orders
"My TradFi open orders"
"Order history"

# Positions
"My positions"
"Position history"

# Market
"TradFi category list"
"Symbol list"
"Ticker for EURUSD"
"Kline 1d for EURUSD"

# Assets
"My TradFi balance"
"Account balance"
"MT5 account"
"My MT5 info"
```

## Security and Scope

- **Read-only**: This skill only queries data. It does **not** place or cancel orders, and does **not** perform fund transfers or balance transfers.
- No credentials are stored or logged; balance, position, and MT5 account data are displayed only in the current response.
- Confirmation is not required for query-only flows.

## Authentication

This skill does **not** handle credentials directly. Authentication is managed by the Gate MCP platform layer — the MCP server holds the user's API key and injects it into API calls automatically. No environment variables or secrets are required by the skill itself. Users should configure their Gate API key in the MCP server settings (see [Gate MCP](https://github.com/gateio/gate-mcp) for setup instructions).
