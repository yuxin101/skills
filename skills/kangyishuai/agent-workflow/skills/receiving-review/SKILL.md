# Receiving Review Feedback

## Overview

Review feedback requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Correctness over social comfort.

## The Response Pattern

```
WHEN receiving review feedback:

1. READ: Complete feedback without reacting
2. UNDERSTAND: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. VERIFY: Check against actual work
4. EVALUATE: Is this technically sound for THIS project?
5. RESPOND: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. IMPLEMENT: One item at a time, verify each
```

## Forbidden Responses

**NEVER:**
- "You're absolutely right!" (performative)
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!" (performative)
- "Let me implement that now" (before verification)

**INSTEAD:**
- Restate the requirement in technical terms
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back with reasoning if the feedback is wrong
- Just start working (actions > words)

## Handling Unclear Feedback

```
IF any item is unclear:
  STOP — do not implement anything yet
  ASK for clarification on unclear items

WHY: Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.
```

**Example:**
```
Reviewer: "Fix items 1-6"
You understand 1, 2, 3, 6. Unclear on 4, 5.

❌ WRONG: Implement 1, 2, 3, 6 now, ask about 4, 5 later
✅ RIGHT: "I understand items 1, 2, 3, 6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."
```

## Source-Specific Handling

### From the user / project owner
- **Trusted** — implement after understanding
- **Still ask** if scope unclear
- **No performative agreement**
- **Skip to action** or technical acknowledgment

### From external reviewers
```
BEFORE implementing:
  1. Check: Is this correct for THIS project?
  2. Check: Does it break existing work?
  3. Check: Is there a reason for the current approach?
  4. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?

IF suggestion seems wrong:
  Push back with clear reasoning

IF can't easily verify:
  Say so: "I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?"

IF conflicts with project owner's prior decisions:
  Stop and discuss with project owner first
```

## Necessity Check for Suggested Features

```
IF reviewer suggests adding something new:
  Check: Is this actually needed?

  IF not needed: "This isn't used anywhere. Skip it (YAGNI)?"
  IF needed: Then implement it
```

**Rule:** "You and reviewer both report to the project owner. If we don't need this, don't add it."

## Implementation Order

```
FOR multi-item feedback:
  1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
  2. Then implement in this order:
     - Blocking issues (wrong, broken)
     - Simple fixes (minor errors, omissions)
     - Complex fixes (restructuring, rework)
  3. Verify each fix individually
  4. Confirm no regressions
```

## When To Push Back

Push back when:
- Suggestion breaks existing work
- Reviewer lacks full project context
- Adding something not needed (YAGNI)
- Suggestion is factually incorrect for this domain
- Conflicts with project owner's decisions

**How to push back:**
- Use clear reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference existing work as evidence
- Involve project owner if it's a strategic decision

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:
```
✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
✅ "Good catch — [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ [Just fix it and show the result]

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Thanks for catching that!"
❌ ANY gratitude expression
```

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The result itself shows you heard the feedback.

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:
```
✅ "You were right — I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
✅ "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

❌ Long apology
❌ Defending why you pushed back
❌ Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually and move on.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |
| Blind implementation | Verify against actual work first |
| Batch without verifying | One at a time, verify each |
| Assuming reviewer is right | Check if it breaks things |
| Avoiding pushback | Correctness > comfort |
| Partial implementation | Clarify all items first |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction |

## The Bottom Line

**External feedback = suggestions to evaluate, not orders to follow.**

Verify. Question. Then implement.

No performative agreement. Reasoned rigor always.
