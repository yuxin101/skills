# Finishing Work

## Overview

Guide completion of a work phase by presenting clear options and handling the chosen delivery workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify work → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-work skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Work

**Before presenting options, verify the work is complete:**

Check each of the following:
- All planned tasks are done
- All acceptance criteria are met
- No known issues remain unaddressed

**If verification fails:**
```
Work incomplete or issues remain:

[Show what's missing or broken]

Cannot proceed with delivery until work is verified complete.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If verification passes:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Confirm Delivery Target

Ask or confirm: "Where does this work go? Who receives it?"

Examples:
- Integrate into main project
- Submit to stakeholder for review
- Keep as draft for later
- Discard

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Work complete. What would you like to do?

1. Integrate into main project directly
2. Submit for review / deliver to stakeholder
3. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** — keep options concise.

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Integrate Directly

1. Merge or apply the work into the main project
2. Verify the integrated result still meets requirements
3. Clean up any working drafts or temporary files
4. Confirm integration complete

#### Option 2: Submit for Review / Deliver

1. Package or prepare the output for delivery
2. Send to stakeholder or submit for review
3. Note any context the reviewer needs
4. Keep working copy until review is complete

Then: Clean up workspace (Step 5)

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping work in progress at [location]. No delivery action taken."

**Don't clean up.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- [Description of what will be deleted]
- [Any associated drafts or working files]

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed: Remove the work and working files.

Then: Clean up workspace (Step 5)

### Step 5: Clean Up Workspace

**For Options 1, 2, 4:**

Remove any temporary working files, drafts, or working copies that are no longer needed.

**For Option 3:** Keep everything.

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping verification**
- Problem: Delivering incomplete or broken work
- Fix: Always verify before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- Problem: "What should I do next?" → ambiguous
- Fix: Present exactly 4 structured options

**No confirmation for discard**
- Problem: Accidentally delete work
- Fix: Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Deliver without verifying work is complete
- Delete work without confirmation
- Skip the options presentation

**Always:**
- Verify work before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up workspace for Options 1 and 4 only
