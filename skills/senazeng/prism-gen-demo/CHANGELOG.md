- **File cleanup**: Eliminated Windows-specific metadata files from the release package

### Changed
- **Bilingual documentation**: Updated SKILL.md to include both English and Chinese descriptions (English-first)
- **Documentation structure**: Implemented hybrid documentation scheme (concise README + detailed technical docs)
- **User experience**: Optimized environment check logic to reduce redundant output
- **Code cleanup**: Removed unnecessary backup files and streamlined scripts

### Compatibility
- **Backward compatible**: All existing functionality remains unchanged

- **API stability**: All command interfaces remain the same

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-06
### Added
- Initial release of PRISM-Gen Demo skill
- Complete data analysis pipeline for drug discovery results
- 6 core functional modules:
  - Data source listing and inspection
  - Filtering and searching
  - Sorting and ranking
  - Merging and aggregation
  - Visualization (distribution plots, scatter plots)
  - Profile summarization
- 10 pre-calculated CSV data files covering all PRISM-Gen stages
- Comprehensive documentation in Chinese and English
- Automated environment setup script
