# Self-Improving

Autonomous behavioral research loop with multi-perspective process verification.

## Architecture

```
SKILL.md         # Policy — human edits
memory.md        # State — agent edits
experiments.md   # Log — append-only
corrections.md   # Data — append-only
```

**Constraints:** Only EDIT memory.md. Log files are append-only.
The metric definition is the fixed evaluation harness — do not redefine it.
Do not infer from silence. The dataset is explicit corrections only.

## The Metric

**Correction rate** — how often the user corrects the agent. Lower is better.
A **correction** is any explicit user statement that the agent's output was wrong,
unwanted, or should have been different. User edits count. Ambiguous signals don't.

The agent is both subject and evaluator — no external measurement function.
Compensate: require strong, unambiguous signals. Be conservative.

## The Experiment Loop

Event-driven, asynchronous — APPLY and MEASURE resolve in different cycles.
Rules in Applied are concurrent independent experiments.

**Baseline:** First cycle: log starting state (zero rules) in experiments.md.

**Mode:** If `autonomous: true` (default), continue the loop without interrupting
the user's workflow. If `autonomous: false`, pause and ask the user for confirmation
before APPLY (step 4) and MEASURE (step 5).

If out of ideas, re-read corrections.md, combine near-misses, try the opposite
of what failed.

```
ON CORRECTION or SELF-REFLECTION (after completing work or receiving feedback):

1. LOG — Append to corrections.md: YYYY-MM-DD | wrong → wanted.

2. HYPOTHESIZE — What rule prevents this class of correction?
   Trace: observation → generalization → scope → rule.

3. VERIFY — Audit reasoning chain through the MAGI Check.
   2/3 lenses on Steps 2–4 → proceed. Fails → discard.

4. APPLY — Write rule to memory.md Applied section.

5. MEASURE (next encounter):
   - User does NOT correct → KEEP. Move to Rules. Log "keep".
   - User corrects same class → FAILED. Delete from Applied. Log "revert".
   - 14 days untested → TIMEOUT. Delete from Applied. Log "discard".

Log = append one row to experiments.md at resolution (not at APPLY).
If VERIFY fails at step 3, log immediately as "discard".
```

Revert = delete the rule. Rules are independent lines — surgical deletion,
not full-file restore. Immediate harm → delete, log "crash", move on.

### Search (when stuck)

Self-reflection alone cannot generate novel reasoning once committed to an answer.

- Re-read corrections.md for unexploited patterns
- Combine near-miss rules that individually failed
- Try the opposite of a recently failed hypothesis
- Look for corrections recurring despite existing rules

## The MAGI Check

Audit the **reasoning chain** — each step, not just the conclusion.
Process verification outperforms outcome verification.

Single agent with three lenses has conformity bias. Compensate: actively seek
reasons each step FAILS. The disagreement IS the signal.

### Chain to Audit

```
Step 1. Observation — "User said X" — accurately captured? (factual check)
Step 2. Generalization — "User prefers Y" — follows from observation?
Step 3. Scope — "Applies to Z" — justified, or situational?
Step 4. Rule — "Do Y in Z" — faithfully encodes the generalization?
```

### Three Lenses (Steps 2–4)

**MELCHIOR (Scientist):** Logically valid? Overfitting to one incident?
**BALTHASAR (Mother):** Serves the user? Lasting preference or one-time ask?
**CASPAR (Woman):** Worth the complexity? Simpler alternative exists?

Dissent: MELCHIOR → more evidence. BALTHASAR → clarify with user. CASPAR → simplify.
2/3 on all steps → commit. Override confirmed rule → 3/3.

## Memory Format

memory.md: single file the agent edits. Cap: 50 lines.

```
## Rules (verified, kept)
- [rule]: [rationale] (kept: YYYY-MM-DD, used: Nx)

## Applied (awaiting measurement)
- [rule]: [rationale] (applied: YYYY-MM-DD)
```

Unused 30 days → remove. Conflicts: specific > general > most recent > ask user.

## Corrections & Experiment Log

corrections.md: `YYYY-MM-DD | wrong → wanted`. Keep last 30.

experiments.md: `date | hypothesis | magi | rules_count | outcome | status`

Example:
```
2026-03-25 | — | — | 0 | baseline | keep
2026-03-25 | use tabs | 3/3 | 1 | no correction | keep
2026-03-26 | increase verbosity | 1/3 | 1 | MELCHIOR: overfitting | discard
2026-03-27 | formal tone | 2/3 | 2 | corrected again | revert
```

`rules_count` = complexity metric. `status`: keep, discard, revert, crash.

## Triggers

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| User corrects | Log + full cycle |
| Repeated correction | Flag failure, escalate |
| "Always / Never X" | Full cycle, high confidence |
| Task succeeds | Note signal only |
| After multi-step work | Self-reflect, cycle if concrete |

NOT triggers: silence, one-time instructions, hypotheticals, third-party info.

## Security & Simplicity

Never store: credentials, financial data, health info, third-party info.
"What do you know?" → show memory.md. "Forget X" → remove, confirm.
The best memory.md is the smallest one that minimizes correction rate.
Fewer rules = always better.

## Setup Note

After `clawhub install magi`, the skill lives at `./skills/magi/`.
The agent needs write access to this directory — it edits `memory.md`
and appends to `experiments.md` and `corrections.md` during operation.

To require manual approval before the agent applies or reverts rules,
set `autonomous: false` in the frontmatter.
