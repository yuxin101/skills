# RealityKit visionOS Developer

## Description and Goals

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for implementing RealityKit-based spatial experiences on visionOS. RealityKit uses an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture where entities are lightweight containers, behavior comes from components, and systems drive per-frame updates.

### Goals

- Enable developers to build immersive 3D experiences on visionOS using RealityKit
- Provide clear guidance on when to use each component and system
- Help developers understand ECS patterns and best practices
- Support debugging and optimization of RealityKit scenes
- Ensure proper integration with SwiftUI via RealityView

## What This Skill Should Do

When implementing RealityKit features on visionOS, this skill should:

1. **Guide component selection** - Help you choose the right components for rendering, interaction, physics, audio, and animation needs
2. **Provide system implementation patterns** - Show how to create custom systems for continuous behavior
3. **Offer code examples** - Demonstrate common patterns like async asset loading, interactive entities, and custom systems
4. **Highlight best practices** - Emphasize proper async loading, component registration, and performance considerations
5. **Warn about pitfalls** - Identify common mistakes like using ARView on visionOS or blocking the main actor

Load the appropriate component or system reference file from the tables below for detailed usage, code examples, and best practices.


## Information About the Skill

### Core Concepts

#### Entities and Components

- Entities are lightweight containers; behavior comes from components.
- Prefer composition over inheritance and use custom `Component` + `Codable` when you need per-entity state.
- Register custom components once with `Component.registerComponent()` before use.
- Mutate entities from documented RealityKit entry points such as `RealityView` closures, event handlers, and systems.

#### RealityView and Attachments

- Use `RealityView` to bridge SwiftUI and RealityKit.
- Load assets with `Entity(named:)` or `Entity(contentsOf:)` asynchronously and handle errors.
- Use the `RealityView` attachments closure when you want SwiftUI attachment entities defined alongside the view, and use `ViewAttachmentComponent` when a component-based attachment is the better fit.

#### Systems and Queries

- Use a custom `System` for continuous, per-frame behavior.
- Query entities with `EntityQuery` + `QueryPredicate` and process them in `update(context:)`.
- Use `SystemDependency` to control update order when multiple systems interact.

### Implementation Patterns

#### RealityView Async Load

```swift
RealityView { content in
    do {
        let entity = try await Entity(named: "Scene")
        content.add(entity)
    } catch {
        print("Failed to load entity: \(error)")
    }
}
```

#### Interactive Entity Setup

```swift
let entity = ModelEntity(mesh: .generateBox(size: 0.1))
entity.components.set(CollisionComponent(shapes: [.generateBox(size: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1])]))
entity.components.set(InputTargetComponent())
entity.components.set(ManipulationComponent())
```

#### Custom System Skeleton

```swift
import RealityKit

struct SpinComponent: Component, Codable {
    var speed: Float
}

struct SpinSystem: System {
    static let query = EntityQuery(where: .has(SpinComponent.self))

    init(scene: Scene) {}

    func update(context: SceneUpdateContext) {
        for entity in context.entities(matching: Self.query, updatingSystemWhen: .rendering) {
            guard let spin = entity.components[SpinComponent.self] else { continue }
            entity.transform.rotation *= simd_quatf(angle: spin.speed * Float(context.deltaTime), axis: [0, 1, 0])
        }
    }
}

SpinSystem.registerSystem()
```

### Pitfalls and Checks

- Always load assets asynchronously; avoid blocking the main actor.
- Avoid `ARView` on visionOS; use `RealityView`.
- Add `CollisionComponent` + `InputTargetComponent` for draggable or tappable entities.
- Use the `RealityView` update closure for state-driven content updates, and prefer a custom `System` for continuous per-frame behavior that spans many entities.
- Built-in mesh generation supports more than the basic primitives, including text and custom mesh content through `MeshResource` APIs.
