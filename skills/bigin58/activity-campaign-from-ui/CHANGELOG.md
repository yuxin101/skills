# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here.

This repository now uses a simple repository version tracked in the `VERSION` file.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Removed the `Local save commands` contract from `SKILL.md` so the skill no longer instructs the model to generate executable shell or PowerShell file-write commands.
- Replaced that section with plain-language file handoff rules that keep outputs organized by file without emitting local command lines.
- Bumped the repository version from `0.1.5` to `0.1.6`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Added `agents/openai.yaml` so the skill has explicit marketplace-facing UI metadata for display name, short description, and default prompt.
- Added `metadata.openclaw.homepage` in `SKILL.md` to point ClawHub users back to the GitHub source repository.

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` to include the new `agents/openai.yaml` file in the documented repository structure.
- Bumped the repository version from `0.1.4` to `0.1.5`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Added explicit reference-to-theme translation rules so the skill no longer blindly follows screenshot colors when the requested campaign theme is different.
- Clarified that visual decisions should prioritize the user brief and target holiday/theme over the reference palette.
- Documented the seasonal mismatch case, including the example of transforming a Spring Festival red-gold reference into a Dragon Boat Festival visual direction.
- Updated `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, and `references/scope.md` to reflect the new visual adaptation rule.
- Bumped the repository version from `0.1.3` to `0.1.4`.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Repositioned `delivery` and `full` outputs from generic starter files to visual-first high-fidelity front-end drafts.
- Strengthened `SKILL.md` with explicit visual extraction, HTML/CSS/JS expectations, and delivery anti-patterns to reduce white-card skeleton outputs.
- Rewrote delivery-focused examples to demonstrate decorated hero layouts, stronger module internals, richer mock data, and branded popup patterns.
- Updated `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, and `references/scope.md` to document the new visual quality bar.
- Bumped the repository version from `0.1.2` to `0.1.3`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Added a practical root `.editorconfig` to keep Markdown and JSON formatting consistent across contributors.
- Added `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` to store the repository publishing checklist inside the repo.

### Changed
- Expanded the root `.gitignore` from a single macOS entry into a usable repository ignore file for system files, editors, archives, temp files, and logs.
- Updated `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` to include `.editorconfig` and `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` in the repository structure.
- Bumped the repository version from `0.1.1` to `0.1.2`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Added a root `LICENSE` file using the MIT license.
- Added a root `CODEOWNERS` template file for repository ownership setup.

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` to include license and ownership files in the repository structure.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include ownership and licensing maintenance guidance.
- Bumped the repository version from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Added a multi-mode workflow to a single skill: `analysis`, `proposal`, `architecture`, `delivery`, and `full`.
- Added dedicated examples for each mode:
  - `examples/mode-analysis-example.md`
  - `examples/mode-proposal-example.md`
  - `examples/mode-architecture-example.md`
  - `examples/mode-delivery-example.md`
  - `examples/full-delivery-example.md`
- Added a richer campaign delivery schema example covering campaign data, modules, popups, state, and delivery-facing structure.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` for repository maintenance rules.
- Added `RELEASE.md` for versioning and release policy.
- Added a root `VERSION` file.

### Changed
- Repositioned the skill from a generic activity-image parser into a campaign generation and delivery skill.
- Standardized the skill as **one skill with multiple modes** instead of a loosely defined all-in-one prompt.
- Locked the supported platform and stack to:
  - H5 / Web
  - HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- Updated `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `SKILL.md`, `references/scope.md`, and all examples to match the fixed-stack strategy.
- Rewrote examples so they no longer imply Vue, React, Uni-app, or other framework outputs.
- Clarified the default mode selection rules when the user does not specify a mode.
- Strengthened anti-copy guidance so the generated campaign must materially differ from the references.
- Standardized starter delivery files to:
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `main.js`
  - `mock-data.js`

### Removed
- Removed leftover multi-framework wording and unsupported stack references.
- Removed repository noise such as `.DS_Store` and `__MACOSX` from packaged outputs.

## Earlier draft stage

### Notes
- Earlier drafts explored a broader direction that mixed activity planning, reference parsing, and multi-stack delivery.
- Those drafts were intentionally narrowed to improve consistency, maintainability, and output quality.
