# Commodities Quote

Retrieve real-time price quotes for commodities including precious metals, energy, and agricultural products using the Octagon MCP server.

## Prerequisites

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the Commodity

Determine the commodity symbol you want to quote:
- **GCUSD**: Gold
- **SIUSD**: Silver
- **CLUSD**: Crude Oil
- **NGUSD**: Natural Gas
- etc.

### 2. Execute Query via Octagon MCP

Use the `octagon-agent` tool with a natural language prompt:

```
Retrieve the real-time price quote for <SYMBOL>.

```json
{
  "server": "octagon-mcp",

- Position: (4,864.20 - 4,690.20) / (4,871.00 - 4,690.20) = 96.2%

**Interpretation**: Trading near the high of the day (bullish).

### 52-Week Range Position

```
Position = (Current - Year Low) / (Year High - Year Low) × 100%
```

### Example

From GCUSD data:
- Current: $4,864.20
- Year Low: $2,837.40
- Year High: $5,626.80
