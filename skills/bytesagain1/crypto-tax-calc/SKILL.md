## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in plain-text files:

- **Location**: `~/.local/share/crypto-tax-calc/` (override with `CRYPTO_TAX_CALC_DIR` env var, or `XDG_DATA_HOME`)
- **Data file**: `data.log` — main transaction ledger
- **History log**: `history.log` — timestamped operation log for audit trail
- **Format**: Pipe-delimited entries with timestamps
- **No cloud sync** — everything stays on your machine, no API keys needed

## Requirements

- Bash 4.0+ (uses `set -euo pipefail`)
- Standard Unix utilities: `date`, `wc`, `tail`, `cat`
- No external dependencies, no API keys, no network access required
- Works on Linux and macOS

## When to Use

1. **Transaction logging** — Record daily purchases, income, and transfers with `crypto-tax-calc track` to build a comprehensive financial history
2. **Budget monitoring** — Use `budget` and `categories` to review spending by category and see where your money goes each month
3. **Monthly summaries** — Run `summary` to get a quick income-vs-expenses overview for the current period without opening a spreadsheet
4. **Period comparison** — Use `compare` to see how your current spending and income stack up against the previous period and spot trends
5. **Data export** — Use `export` to generate CSV output that can be imported into spreadsheets, tax software, or other financial tools

## Examples

```bash
# Record a transaction
crypto-tax-calc track "coffee shop" 4.50

# Check your current balance
crypto-tax-calc balance

# View monthly financial summary

# Export all transactions to CSV (pipe to file)
