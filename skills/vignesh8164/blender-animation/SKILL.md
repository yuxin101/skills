# \# Blender Animation Skill

# 

# \## Purpose

# This skill enables automated 3D animation generation using Blender in headless mode. It is designed for controlled, programmatic scene creation and rendering workflows in server or agent environments.

# 

# \---

# 

# \## When to use

# 

# Use this skill when:

# \- Generating 3D animations programmatically

# \- Creating motion graphics using Blender

# \- Rendering animation output without GUI

# \- Automating scene setup, lighting, and camera movement

# 

# Do NOT use this skill for:

# \- Arbitrary system command execution

# \- File system exploration outside task scope

# \- Network-based operations unless explicitly required

# 

# \---

# 

# \## Capabilities

# 

# \- Scene creation using Blender Python (bpy)

# \- Object animation and transformations

# \- Camera setup and motion

# \- Lighting configuration

# \- Rendering animation to MP4 format

# \- Headless execution (no GUI)

# 

# \---

# 

# \## Execution Model

# 

# 1\. Generate a Blender Python script

# 2\. Save script to:

# &#x20;  /tmp/blender\_script.py

# 3\. Execute Blender in headless mode using:

# &#x20;  scripts/run\_blender.sh

# 4\. Output is saved to:

# &#x20;  /tmp/output.mp4

# 

# \---

# 

# \## Safety \& Constraints

# 

# \- Execution is limited to Blender-related operations only

# \- No arbitrary shell commands outside the defined script runner

# \- No modification of system files outside `/tmp`

# \- No access to sensitive directories (e.g., /etc, /home)

# \- Network access should not be used unless explicitly required

# \- Scripts must only perform scene creation and animation tasks

# \- Avoid large resource usage (default animation limit: 10 seconds)

# 

# \---

# 

# \## Sandbox Expectation

# 

# This skill is intended to run in a controlled or sandboxed environment such as:

# \- Containerized execution (Docker)

# \- Restricted agent runtime

# \- Limited-permission server environment

# 

# \---

# 

# \## Rules

# 

# \- Always run Blender in headless mode

# \- Never open GUI

# \- Always generate a Python script before execution

# \- Keep animations under 10 seconds unless specified

# \- Always return output file path and logs

# 

# \---

# 

# \## Output

# 

# Return:

# \- Rendered video file (/tmp/output.mp4)

# \- Blender Python script used

# \- Execution logs

# 

# \---

# 

# \## Transparency Notice

# 

# This skill executes generated Python scripts within Blender.  

# Users should review generated scripts if operating in sensitive environments.

#

# 

# \## Version

# 

# v1.0.1 — Security and safety improvements added
