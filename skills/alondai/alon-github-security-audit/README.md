# Alon GitHub Security Audit Skill

Audit GitHub repositories or local codebases for malicious code, backdoors, and supply-chain risk without executing the target project by default.

## Quick Install

Planned public install path:

```bash
npx skills add alondai/alon-skills --skill alon-github-security-audit
```

Current local install path during private development:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.claude/skills/alon-github-security-audit
ls -l ~/.claude/skills/alon-github-security-audit
```

## When to Use

Use this skill when you want to:

- audit a GitHub repository before installing or trusting it
- review a local codebase for malicious behavior
- inspect agent skills, automation tools, or installer scripts
- perform a static-first security review before any deeper investigation

Typical user prompts:

- `审计下 https://github.com/owner/repo`
- `审计当前目录`
- `audit this repo`
- `check repo security`

## What It Does

- performs a default offline static audit
- inspects network indicators, exfiltration paths, obfuscation, and install chains
- adds a source-and-permissions preflight for skills and automation tools
- can optionally extend into online dependency vulnerability intelligence after confirmation
- writes a structured audit report to the configured local report directory

## Safety and Limits

- default mode is read-only static analysis
- default analysis scope is limited to the target repository or the current working directory
- it does not execute target repository code
- it does not run `npm install`, `pip install`, or similar install steps
- it does not query external vulnerability sources unless the user explicitly approves
- it does not read unrelated home-directory paths such as `~/.ssh` or browser profile data unless the user explicitly expands scope
- local-directory audits do not delete user files

This skill is designed for triage and security review, not for proving runtime exploitability.

## Output

The audit result includes:

- high-risk entities
- logic risk analysis
- optional supplemental checks
- a final verdict: `Safe`, `Risky`, or `Dangerous`
- an audit report written to the configured local report directory

## Local Development

- Python 3.6+
- Git

The canonical private source lives in the local skills workspace and may contain host-specific private workflow details. Public-safe export cleanup should happen later during release export, not during private development.

In the current private workflow, reports are written to a local report directory and may later be imported into Obsidian by separate tooling.
