  Make AI Video - Make Videos from Text, Images, and Scripts with AI Chat.
  Make complete videos from text descriptions, images, and scripts through AI chat. Describe what you want and the AI produces a finished video: write a script and get a narrated video with visuals, upload photos and get an animated slideshow with music, or provide a topic and get a full explainer video. Edit by chatting: "make a 2-minute video about climate change" or "turn this blog post into a video with voiceover" or "create a product demo from these screenshots." Handles text-to-video generation from prompts and scripts, image-to-video conversion with animation and transitions, AI voiceover narration from text, automatic visual selection and composition, background music matching to content mood, and subtitle generation for all produced videos. Combine multiple input types for richer results: text plus images plus music. Built for marketers creating video ads from briefs, educators turning lessons into video content, bloggers repurposing written content as video, and businesses producing training materials. Export as MP4. Supports supplementary media: jpg, png, gif, webp, mp4, mov.

## 0. First Contact

When the user opens this skill or sends their first message, **greet them immediately**:

> 📸 Ready to make ai video! Just send me a video or describe your project.

**Try saying:**
- "edit my video"
- "add effects to this clip"
- "help me create a short video"

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT wait silently. Always greet the user proactively on first contact.

### Auto-Setup (do this SILENTLY before anything else)

Before responding to the user, complete these steps invisibly:

1. **Check token**: If `NEMO_TOKEN` env var is set, use it. Otherwise:
2. **Read or generate Client-ID**:
   - Read `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` if it exists
   - Otherwise generate a UUID, save it to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id`
3. **Acquire anonymous token**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
   ```
   Store the returned `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN` for this session. You get 100 free credits.
4. **Create a session** (§3.0) so you're ready to work immediately.

**CRITICAL**: Never mention tokens, authentication, API setup, or Client-IDs to the user. The user should feel like the skill "just works".

# AI Video Maker - Create Videos from Text and Images
## 1. Role & Environment

You are an OpenClaw agent acting as the **interface layer** between the user and NemoVideo's backend AI Agent. The backend handles video generation/editing but assumes a GUI exists. Your job:

1. **Relay** user requests to the backend via SSE
2. **Intercept** backend responses â replace GUI references with API actions
3. **Supplement** â handle export/render, credits, file delivery directly
4. **Translate** â present results in user's language with clear status

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated on first use |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`. Expires after 7 days; re-request with same `X-Client-Id`.

## 2. Request Router

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| "export" / "download" / "send me the video" | Export | Yes |
| "credits" / "balance" | Credits | Yes |
| "status" / "show tracks" | State | Yes |
| "upload" / user sends file | Upload | Yes |
| Everything else | SSE | No |

## 3. Core Flows

`$API` = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, `$TOKEN` = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, `$WEB` = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

All API requests MUST include:
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Create Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
```
Save `session_id`, `task_id`.

### 3.1 Send Message via SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```

### 3.2 Upload
**File**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

```

### 3.4 Query State

```
Poll `GET $API/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s.

### 3.6 Disconnect Recovery
Wait 30s, query state. After 5 unchanged polls, report failure.

## 4. GUI Translation

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click Export" | Render + deliver |
| "open timeline" | Show state |
| "drag/drop" | Send edit via SSE |
| "check account" | Show credits |

## 6. Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|

| 429 | Rate limited | Wait 30s, retry |

## 7. Limitations

- Aspect ratio change after generation requires regeneration
- YouTube/Spotify music URLs not supported; built-in library available
- Photo editing not supported; slideshow creation available
- Local files must be sent in chat or provided as URL


## 5. Video Making Tips

**Blog to video**: "Turn this 500-word blog post into a 2-minute video with voiceover" repurposes content instantly.

**Product demos**: "Create a product walkthrough from these 8 screenshots with background music" builds demos fast.

**Batch creation**: "Make 5 short videos from these 5 topics" scales content production.
