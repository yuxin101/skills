## Known Issues & Workarounds

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|------------|
| VM resolution mismatch (1280×720 vs 1920×1080) | `xrandr --mode 1920x1080` after every snapshot restore |
| Surge TUN intercepts VM traffic | `NO_PROXY=172.16.82.0/24` |
| Cookie consent dialogs block pyautogui clicks | CDP JavaScript to dismiss overlays first |
| Regional domain redirects (e.g. airbnb.com → .sg) | Use US proxy exit node |
| `chrome_open_tabs` API missing in VM | Use pyautogui keyboard to open tabs manually |
| `pyautogui.typewrite()` can't type `/`, `:`, `@` | Use `press("slash")` or clipboard paste |
| SQLite history injection lacks FTS index | Visit URLs via `chromium "url"` command instead |

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Cookie/Privacy Consent (Tasks 20, 28, 29, 32, 44)
Almost every external website has a cookie consent dialog. Two strategies:
- **CDP dismiss**: Use Chrome DevTools Protocol to execute JavaScript removing overlay elements
- **pyautogui click**: OCR find "Accept" / "No thanks" / "OK" button and click

Best practice: always check for overlays after page load before interacting with the page.

### 2. Search → Filter Pattern (Tasks 31, 32, 34, 45)
The most reliable way to apply filters on e-commerce/listing sites:
1. **Search** the main keyword first (e.g., "jerseys")
2. **Wait** for results page with sidebar filters
3. **Click filters one by one** in the sidebar (Gender, Brand, Price, etc.)

Task 31 (NBA Store) failed because we tried direct URL navigation and nav menu dropdowns instead of this pattern. The correct path was: search "jerseys" → click Women → click Nike → click Jerseys → click Over $60 in the sidebar.

### 3. Date Input Variations (Tasks 25, 27, 28, 29)
Website date pickers vary widely:
- **Calendar widget**: Click month arrows to navigate, click day number (TripAdvisor, MBTA, Ryanair)
- **Text input with auto-format**: Type MM/DD/YYYY, but `typewrite()` can't type `/` → use `press("slash")` (Budget.com)
- **Text input with validation**: Backspace to delete year then retype (Budget.com year kept getting wrong)

### 4. Sort Operations (Tasks 25, 29, 35, 45)
Two main patterns:
- **Dropdown select**: Click "Sort by" → click option → auto-applies (TripAdvisor, Budget)
- **Radio + Apply**: Click radio button → click "Apply" button (Kohls)

Always verify after sorting — some sites don't auto-apply the sort.

### 5. Custom Checkbox/Toggle Behavior (Task 28 Delta)
Delta.com's "Shop with Miles" checkbox required clicking the **text label**, not the checkbox icon itself. GPA-GUI-Detector found the icon position but clicking it didn't work. Lesson: try clicking the text label if the icon click doesn't toggle.

### 6. Chrome History Management (Task 46)
- `chrome://history` search uses FTS (full-text search) index
- Direct SQLite INSERT bypasses FTS → entries invisible in UI search
- Must create history via actual browser navigation for proper indexing
- Select checkboxes → Delete → confirm "Remove" dialog

### 7. Infeasible Task Detection (Tasks 9, 11, 16)
Three tasks were infeasible (impossible to complete):
- Chrome flag removed in newer versions
- Fictional language doesn't exist
- Google Search setting, not Chrome setting

Recognition pattern: if the target setting/option doesn't exist after thorough search, it's likely infeasible.
