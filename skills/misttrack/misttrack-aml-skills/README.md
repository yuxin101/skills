## Example Prompts

### Quick Risk Check (KYT)

### Full Address Investigation

- Run a complete on-chain investigation on `0x6487B5006904f3Db3C4a3654409AE92b87eD442f` - labels, balance, risk score, platform interactions, and counterparties
- Where did the funds in BTC address `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7Divf` come from and go to?
- Analyze the behavior of `0xd90e2f925da726b50c4ed8d0fb90ad053324f31b` - is it mostly interacting with DEXes, mixers, or exchanges?

# Single address risk score
python scripts/risk_check.py --address 0x... --coin ETH

# Batch async risk scoring
python scripts/batch_risk_check.py --input addresses.txt --coin ETH

# Full address investigation
python scripts/address_investigation.py --address 0x... --coin ETH

# Pre-transfer security check
