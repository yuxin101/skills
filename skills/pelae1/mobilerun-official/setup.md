# Mobilerun Setup

This document describes how Mobilerun authentication and device connectivity works,
so you can diagnose issues and guide the user through setup when needed.

## Authentication

### How It Works

Mobilerun uses API keys for programmatic access. All API calls go to `https://api.mobilerun.ai/v1`
with the user's key in the Authorization header.

- Keys are prefixed with `dr_sk_` -- if a user provides something without this prefix, it's not a valid Mobilerun key
- Keys are created from the Mobilerun dashboard at cloud.mobilerun.ai and can be revoked or expired
- Each key is tied to a single user account
- The key is stored securely via the `MOBILERUN_API_KEY` environment variable — never hardcode or expose it

### Getting an API Key

The user needs to:

1. Go to **https://cloud.mobilerun.ai/api-keys**
   - If not logged in, the page redirects to login first (Google, GitHub, or Discord -- no email/password option)
   - After login it redirects back to the API keys page
2. Click the **"New Key"** button
3. Give the key a name (anything descriptive is fine)
4. Copy the full key -- it's only shown once at creation time

The key will look like: `dr_sk_a1b2c3d4e5f6...`

### Verifying the API Key

After receiving a key from the user, verify it works by calling `GET /devices` with the key. 

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `200` with JSON body | Key is valid. The response shows the user's devices (may be empty if no devices connected yet) |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Key is invalid, expired, or revoked |

### Troubleshooting Auth Issues

**User provides a key that doesn't start with `dr_sk_`:**
- It's not a Mobilerun API key. Ask them to copy it again from https://cloud.mobilerun.ai/api-keys

**401 on a key that previously worked:**
- The key may have been revoked or expired. Ask the user to check the API keys page and create a new one if needed

**User says they can't find the API keys page:**
- Direct them to https://cloud.mobilerun.ai/api-keys -- they need to be logged in first

**User doesn't have an account:**
- They can create one by going to https://cloud.mobilerun.ai/sign-in and signing in with Google, GitHub, or Discord. First login automatically creates an account.

## Device Connectivity

### Personal Devices (Portal APK)

A personal device is the user's own Android phone connected to Mobilerun via the Droidrun Portal app.

#### Installing the Portal APK

1. On the Android device, go to **https://droidrun.ai/portal** -- this redirects to the latest GitHub release
2. Download the file named `droidrun-portal-vx.x.x.apk` (the version number varies)
3. Open/install the downloaded APK
   - Android may warn about installing from unknown sources -- the user needs to allow it

#### Connecting to Mobilerun

Once the Portal app is installed and opened:

1. **Grant accessibility permission**: A red banner at the top says "Accessibility Service Not Enabled" -- tap **"Enable Now"** and follow the system prompts to enable it. This is required for the agent to read the UI tree and control the device.
2. **Connect to Mobilerun** -- two options:
   - **Tap** "Connect to Mobilerun" -> opens a login page where the user signs in with their account (Google, GitHub, or Discord)
   - **Long-press** "Connect to Mobilerun" -> opens a field labeled "Token" -- despite the label, the user should paste their Mobilerun API key (`dr_sk_...`) here, then tap **Connect**
3. The app connects to Mobilerun and the device should appear in `GET /devices` with `state: "ready"`.

The agent should provide the API key to the user at step 2 -- the same key used for API calls.

#### Checking Device Status

Call `GET /devices` and look for a device with `provider: "personal"`:

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| No personal device in list | Portal APK isn't installed, not connected, or accessibility permission not granted |
| Device with `state: "ready"` | Device is connected and ready to use |
| Device with `state: "disconnected"` | Portal app lost connection. User should check that the app is open and phone has internet |

#### Common Issues

- **Device shows `disconnected`**: Portal app was closed, phone went to sleep with aggressive battery optimization, or phone lost internet. Ask user to reopen the Portal app.
- **Device was `ready` but stops responding**: The phone may have locked or the Portal app was killed by the OS. Ask user to check the phone.
- **No device appears at all**: Portal APK isn't installed, accessibility permission wasn't granted, or the user didn't connect with their API key.
- **Connection fails in Portal app**: The API key may be wrong or expired. Ask the user to verify the key.

### Cloud Devices

Cloud devices are virtual/emulated devices hosted by Mobilerun. They require a paid subscription.

If a user tries to provision a cloud device without the right plan, the API will return an error.
In that case, let them know they need to upgrade at https://cloud.mobilerun.ai.

Cloud devices go through these states after provisioning:
`creating` -> `assigned` -> `ready`

Use `GET /devices/{deviceId}/wait` to block until the device is ready (avoids polling).

## Accounts & Plans

- **Free accounts** can connect personal devices via Portal APK and use the Tools API to control them
- **Paid plans** add cloud device provisioning, task execution (AI agent credits), and additional features

For full plan details (Hobby, Starter, Pro, Enterprise), see [subscription.md](./subscription.md).

If an API call fails with a billing/plan error, direct the user to https://cloud.mobilerun.ai/billing.

## Quick Checklist

When starting a session, verify:

1. **API key works** -- `GET /devices` returns 200
2. **Device is available** -- at least one device with `state: "ready"` in the response
3. **Device is responsive** -- `GET /devices/{id}/screenshot` returns a PNG image

If all three pass, you're ready to control the phone. See [phone-api.md](./phone-api.md) for the full API reference.
