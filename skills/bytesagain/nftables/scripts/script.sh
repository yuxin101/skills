# Nftables — Common Patterns & Best Practices

## Design Patterns
1. **Standard Pattern**: The most common approach for nftables
2. **Scalable Pattern**: For high-volume or distributed scenarios
3. **Resilient Pattern**: For fault-tolerant implementations

## Best Practices
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use version control for all configurations
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Test changes in staging before production
- Document all custom configurations

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Hardcoding credentials or configuration
- Skipping validation and error handling
- Ignoring monitoring and alerting
- Making changes without documentation
- Over-engineering simple solutions

    cat << 'EOF'
# Nftables — Debugging Guide

## Common Errors
1. **Connection refused**: Check service status and network
2. **Permission denied**: Verify credentials and access rights
3. **Timeout**: Check network, increase limits, optimize queries
4. **Invalid input**: Validate data format and encoding

## Debugging Tools
- Built-in logging and diagnostics
- Network analysis tools (tcpdump, wireshark)
- System monitoring (top, htop, iostat)
- Application-specific debug modes

## Debug Workflow
1. Reproduce the issue consistently
2. Check logs for error messages
3. Isolate the failing component
4. Test with minimal configuration
5. Apply fix and verify

cmd_performance() {
    cat << 'EOF'
# Nftables — Performance Optimization

## Key Metrics
- Response time / latency
- Throughput / operations per second
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Error rate and retry frequency

## Optimization Strategies
1. **Caching**: Reduce redundant operations
2. **Batching**: Group small operations
3. **Indexing**: Speed up data lookups
4. **Compression**: Reduce data transfer size
5. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple cores

## Monitoring
- Set up baseline performance metrics
- Configure alerts for anomalies
- Track trends over time
- Regular capacity planning reviews

cmd_security() {
    cat << 'EOF'
# Nftables — Security Considerations

## Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong, unique credentials
- Implement role-based access control
- Enable multi-factor authentication where possible
- Regularly review and rotate credentials

## Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper backup procedures
- Follow data retention policies
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection

## Network Security
- Use firewalls and network segmentation
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Keep all software patched and updated
- Disable unnecessary services and ports

    cat << 'EOF'
# Nftables — Migration & Upgrade Guide

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Current system fully documented
- [ ] Complete backup taken and verified
- [ ] Target environment prepared
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

## Migration Steps
1. Prepare target environment
2. Export data from source
3. Transform data if needed
4. Import to target
5. Verify data integrity
6. Update configurations
7. Test all functionality
8. Switch traffic / go live

## Post-Migration
- Monitor for errors and performance
- Verify all integrations working
- Update documentation
- Decommission old system after confirmation

## Essential Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| help | Show available commands |
| version | Display version info |
| intro | Overview and fundamentals |
| troubleshooting | Common problems and fixes |

## Common Workflows
1. **Setup**: install → configure → verify → test
2. **Daily**: check → monitor → report → review
3. **Issue**: diagnose → isolate → fix → verify → document

## Key Shortcuts
- Use tab completion for commands
- Check logs first when troubleshooting
- Always backup before making changes
- Document everything you change
