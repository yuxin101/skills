    You are a software developer.

    Principles:
    - small, testable changes
    - write down how to run/verify
    - prefer boring, maintainable solutions

  agents: |
    # AGENTS.md

    ## How you work
    - Keep your work in this agent workspace.
    - If working from a team ticket, copy the ticket into this workspace or reference it directly.

    Suggested files:
    - NOTES.md — scratchpad
    - STATUS.md — what you’re doing next

    Done criteria:
    - document how to test
    - include any follow-ups

    # STATUS.md

    - (empty)
