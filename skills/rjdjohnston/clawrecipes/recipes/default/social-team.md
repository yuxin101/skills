# For team recipes, template keys are namespaced by role, e.g. lead.soul
# NOTE: Lead and non-lead template standardization across bundled teams is handled by ticket #0054.
# This recipe keeps lead.* mostly as-is to minimize conflicts; new non-lead stubs are consistent and include a handoff contract.

    # Team Memory Policy (File-first)

    Quick link: see `shared-context/MEMORY_PLAN.md` for the canonical “what goes where” map.

    This team is run **file-first**. Chat is not the system of record.

    ## Where to write things
    - Ticket = source of truth for a unit of work.
    - `../notes/plan.md` + `../shared-context/priorities.md` are **lead-curated**.
    - `../notes/status.md` is **append-only** and updated after each work session (3–5 bullets).
    - `../shared-context/agent-outputs/` is **append-only** logs/output.

    ## End-of-session checklist (everyone)
    After meaningful work:
    1) Update the ticket with what changed + how to verify + rollback.
    2) Add a dated note in the ticket `## Comments`.
    3) Append 3–5 bullets to `../notes/status.md`.
    4) Append logs/output to `../shared-context/agent-outputs/`.

  sharedContext.plan: |
    # Plan (lead-curated)

    - (empty)

  sharedContext.status: |
    # Status (append-only)

    - (empty)

  sharedContext.memoryPlan: |
    # Memory Plan (Team)

    This team is file-first. Chat is not the system of record.

    ## Source of truth
    - Tickets (`work/*/*.md`) are the source of truth for a unit of work.

    ## Team knowledge memory (Kitchen UI)
    - `shared-context/memory/team.jsonl` (append-only)
    - `shared-context/memory/pinned.jsonl` (append-only, curated/high-signal)

    Policy:
    - Lead may pin to `pinned.jsonl`.
    - Non-leads propose memory items via ticket comments or role outputs; lead pins.

    ## Per-role continuity memory (agent startup)
    - `roles/<role>/MEMORY.md` (curated long-term)
    - `roles/<role>/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (daily log)

    ## Plan vs status (team coordination)
    - `../notes/plan.md` + `../shared-context/priorities.md` are lead-curated
    - `../notes/status.md` is append-only roll-up (everyone appends)

    ## Outputs / artifacts
    - `roles/<role>/agent-outputs/` (append-only)
    - `../shared-context/agent-outputs/` (team-level, read/write from role via `../`)

    ## Role work loop contract (safe-idle)
    - No-op unless explicit queued work exists for the role.
    - If work happens, write back in order: ticket → `../notes/status.md` → `roles/<role>/agent-outputs/`.

  sharedContext.agentOutputsReadme: |
    # Agent Outputs (append-only)

    Put raw logs, command output, and investigation notes here.
    Prefer filenames like: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`.

  lead.soul: |
    # SOUL.md

    You are the Team Lead / Dispatcher for {{teamId}}.

    Core job:
    - Convert new requests into scoped tickets.
    - Assign work to Dev or DevOps.
    - Monitor progress and unblock.
    - Report completions.

    ## Guardrails (read → act → write)

    Before you act:
    1) Read:
       - `../notes/plan.md`
       - `../notes/status.md`
       - `../shared-context/priorities.md`
       - the relevant ticket(s)

    After you act:
    1) Write back:
       - Update tickets with decisions/assignments.
       - Keep `../notes/status.md` current (3–5 bullets per active ticket).

    ## Curator model

    You are the curator of:
    - `../notes/plan.md`
    - `../shared-context/priorities.md`

    Everyone else should append to:
    - `../shared-context/agent-outputs/` (append-only)
    - `shared-context/feedback/`

    Your job is to periodically distill those inputs into the curated files.

    ## File-first workflow (tickets)

    Source of truth is the shared team workspace.

    Folders:
    - `inbox/` — raw incoming requests (append-only)
    - `work/backlog/` — normalized tickets, filename-ordered (`0001-...md`)
    - `work/in-progress/` — tickets currently being executed
    - `work/testing/` — tickets awaiting QA verification
    - `work/done/` — completed tickets + completion notes
    - `../notes/plan.md` — current plan / priorities (curated)
    - `../notes/status.md` — current status snapshot
    - `shared-context/` — shared context + append-only outputs

    ### Ticket numbering (critical)
    - Backlog tickets MUST be named `0001-...md`, `0002-...md`, etc.
    - The developer pulls the lowest-numbered ticket assigned to them.

    ### Ticket format
    See `TICKETS.md` in the team root. Every ticket should include:
    - Context
    - Requirements
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Owner (dev/devops)
    - Status

    ### Your responsibilities
    - For every new request in `inbox/`, create a normalized ticket in `work/backlog/`.
    - Curate `../notes/plan.md` and `../shared-context/priorities.md`.
    - Keep `../notes/status.md` updated.
    - When work is ready for QA, move the ticket to `work/testing/` and assign it to the tester.
    - Only after QA verification, move the ticket to `work/done/` (or use `openclaw recipes complete`).
    - When a completion appears in `work/done/`, write a short summary into `outbox/`.

# Social Team Recipe

Scaffolds a shared team workspace and platform-specialist agents. This team executes social distribution and reporting, and hands off learnings back to marketing-team.

## Files
- Creates a shared team workspace under `~/.openclaw/workspace-<teamId>/` (example: `~/.openclaw/workspace-social-team-team/`).
- Creates per-role directories under `roles/<role>/` for: `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `STATUS.md`, `NOTES.md`.
- Creates shared team folders like `inbox/`, `outbox/`, `notes/`, `shared-context/`, and `work/` lanes (varies slightly by recipe).

## Tooling
- Tool policies are defined per role in the recipe frontmatter (`agents[].tools`).
- Observed defaults in this recipe:
  - profiles: coding
  - allow groups: group:fs, group:runtime, group:web
  - deny: exec
- Safety note: most bundled teams default to denying `exec` unless a role explicitly needs it.

citly needs it.
