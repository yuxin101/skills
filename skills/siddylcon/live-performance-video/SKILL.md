# Live Performance Video Maker — Create Stage and Venue Performance Documentation

Describe your performance and NemoVideo creates the video. Theater shows, comedy nights, dance recitals, spoken word events, improv performances — narrate the show, the space, the moment that made it, and what the audience experienced, and get a performance video that documents your work for portfolio, promotion, and archiving.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for live performance documentation across all performing arts:
- Create theater production highlight and full-show documentation videos
- Film dance company and choreography documentation for portfolio and auditions
- Build comedy club performance videos for comedian press kits
- Document spoken word and poetry slam performance content
- Create improv and sketch comedy show highlight reels
- Produce circus, variety, and specialty performance documentation

## How to Describe Your Performance

Be specific about the art form, the venue, the piece performed, and the moments that define the show.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "Contemporary dance piece 'Groundwater' by the Meridian Dance Company: 22 minutes, 5 dancers, exploring themes of environmental erasure. The piece uses water on the stage floor (actual water, 2 inches deep, the dancers work in it the whole time). Key moments: the opening where a single dancer enters before the lights are up (silhouette in black water), the central quintet where all five dancers move in synchronized slowness for 8 minutes, and the ending where they collectively push the water to the walls and stand on dry floor. For company portfolio and festival submissions."
- "Stand-up comedy set at a 150-cap room: 25-minute set, third night of a 5-night run. The comedian is Priya Nair, observational comedy about growing up between two cultures. The room was sold out, laughs came hard. Best moment: the bit about her grandmother learning to use an iPhone that went 4 minutes over expected because of the crowd response. Single camera, nothing fancy, for her press kit."
- "Shakespeare in the park: A Midsummer Night's Dream, outdoor stage, summer evening. 90 audience members in folding chairs, fairy lights strung through actual trees, the set is minimal (two benches and a lot of imagination). Show the magic of outdoor Shakespeare — the fireflies that showed up during Act 3, the kid in the front row who was completely lost in it, the Puck who played the whole thing like stand-up comedy."

## Tips for Best Results

- **Purpose shapes everything**: Portfolio for festival applications is different from social media clips — set `purpose` explicitly so the pacing, length, and framing are appropriate
- **The key moment is the portfolio's center**: One extraordinary moment (the water stage, the 4-minute crowd response bit, the fireflies in Act 3) is what makes the documentation memorable — describe it specifically
- **Audience reactions signal the art's impact**: Set `show_audience: true` for comedy and theater where the audience response IS the documentation — a silent audience shot during a standing ovation says what words can't
- **Art form dictates camera style**: Dance documentation is wide-shot with technique visible; comedy is tight on face and crowd; theater is scene-by-scene storytelling
- **Portfolio and promo are different products**: Portfolio for bookers should be uncut and representative; promo for social should be the peak 60 seconds — make both

## Common Questions

**What's the right video length for a festival application?**
3-8 minutes for most performing arts festivals. Edinburgh Fringe, for example, wants to see the work clearly — long enough to understand it, short enough to stay focused. Set `purpose: "portfolio"` and `duration_minutes: 5-8`.

**Should dance documentation show the full piece or highlights?**
For portfolio submissions, show key sections that represent the full aesthetic. For social media, take the most visually compelling 60-90 seconds. Describe both if you need both formats.

**Can I document multiple shows in one video?**
Yes — describe the shows in sequence and set `content_type: "highlight_reel"`. Useful for company annual reels or comedian year-in-review content.
