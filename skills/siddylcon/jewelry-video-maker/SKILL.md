# Jewelry Video Maker — Film Gemstone and Sterling Silver Pieces for Etsy and DTC Shops

Describe your jewelry piece and NemoVideo creates the product video. 925 sterling silver rings, gemstone pendants, handmade bracelets — show the loupe-level detail, the styling moment, and the brand story that converts Etsy browsers into buyers.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for jewelry product content:

## Tips for Best Results

- **Specify the material precisely**: "925 sterling silver" outperforms "silver" — buyers search by metal quality
- **Name the gemstone**: "labradorite" with its color flash description creates more compelling video than "blue stone"
- **Include loupe detail**: `show_loupe: true` creates the close-up moment that shows craftsmanship and justifies price
- **Platform matters**: Etsy videos are horizontal (1:1 square), Instagram prefers vertical (9:16)
- **Brand name on screen**: `brand_name` parameter adds your shop name as a watermark/end card

## Common Questions

**Can I show gemstone color play (labradorescence, opal fire)?**
Yes — describe the optical effect ("blue-green flash when tilted in light") and set `show_loupe: true`. NemoVideo creates a slow pan that captures the phenomenon.

**What background works best for 925 sterling silver?**
White or marble backgrounds prevent color contamination. For oxidized or blackened silver, dark velvet makes the texture pop.

**Can I create a series for my entire Etsy shop?**
Yes — send separate API calls per piece and batch them. Consistent `background` and `brand_name` settings keep your shop visuals cohesive.

**How do I show the loupe-level gemstone detail?**
Set `show_loupe: true` and describe the facets or inclusions in the prompt. NemoVideo renders a simulated macro close-up that highlights stone quality.
