# Gym Transformation Video Maker — Document Before-After Fitness Journey Content

Describe your transformation and NemoVideo builds the video. Three-month weight loss, 6-month muscle gain, body recomposition — turn your before-after photos and progress data into an inspiring gym journey video that motivates and converts.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for fitness transformation content:
- Create before-after body transformation reveal videos
- Document weight loss journeys with weekly progress photos
- Show muscle-building timelines with measurement and strength gains
- Build motivational fitness content around a specific challenge or goal
- Create "what I did differently" breakdown videos after hitting a milestone
- Produce gym anniversary content (1 year of lifting, 100 days of running)

## How to Describe Your Transformation

Be specific about starting point, end point, timeline, and key changes.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "12-week fat loss transformation: started at 195lb 28% body fat, finished at 172lb 19% — show before photo, weekly progress, final reveal, key changes (diet, training split). Motivational, not before-after shock value."
- "6-month beginner gains: went from 140lb skinny to 162lb — tracked bench from 95lb to 185lb, squat from 135lb to 225lb. Show the progress photos and strength numbers."
- "90-day body recomposition: same weight (155lb) but visible muscle definition gained, lost 3 inches off waist — show comparison photos, diet approach (high protein), training routine"

## Key Parameters

|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `transformation_type` | Journey focus | `"fat_loss"`, `"muscle_gain"`, `"recomposition"`, `"strength"`, `"endurance"` |
| `timeline_weeks` | Duration of journey | `12`, `16`, `24`, `52` |
| `metrics` | Key numbers to show | `{"start_weight": 195, "end_weight": 172, "start_bf": 28, "end_bf": 19}` |

## Workflow

1. Describe your starting state, ending state, and timeline
2. NemoVideo structures the narrative arc (before → process → after)
3. Progress metrics, timeline markers, and key milestones overlaid automatically
4. Export with motivational framing tailored to your platform

      "prompt": "6-month beginner muscle building: started at 140lb skinny fat, ended at 162lb with visible muscle. Bench went from 95lb to 185lb, squat from 135lb to 225lb.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Include real numbers**: "lost 23lb" beats "lost a lot of weight" — specific metrics make transformations credible
- **Describe the process too**: What you ate, how you trained — the method is as compelling as the result
- **Choose tone carefully**: "motivational" uses upbeat music and dramatic reveals; "educational" focuses on what worked and why
- **Timeline markers matter**: Monthly photo updates create better pacing than just before-after
- **Avoid shock value framing**: Frame around achievement, not appearance criticism

## Common Questions

**Can I upload my own progress photos?**
Yes — pass image URLs in the `images` array. NemoVideo incorporates your actual before-after photos with consistent framing.

**How do I show strength gains alongside physique changes?**
Include lift numbers in the prompt and set `include_stats: true` — NemoVideo overlays your PR progression alongside the visual transformation.

**What's the difference between reveal_style options?**
`side_by_side` shows before and after simultaneously. `sequential` transitions from before to after. `timeline_scroll` shows monthly progression chronologically.
