# Wildlife Video Maker — Create Nature Documentary and Wildlife Observation Content

Describe your wildlife encounter and NemoVideo creates the video. Backyard birds at the feeder, deer in the meadow at dawn, humpback whale bubble-net feeding — narrate what you witnessed and get nature documentary-style content that captures the wild world.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for wildlife and nature observation content:
- Create backyard wildlife feeder and garden visitor documentation videos
- Film bird watching content with species identification and behavior notes
- Build wildlife safari and nature tour experience videos
- Document rare wildlife encounters and behavioral observations
- Create nature documentary-style narrated wildlife sequences
- Produce citizen science documentation for wildlife monitoring projects

## How to Describe Your Wildlife Observation

Be specific about the species, the behavior, the location, and what made this sighting remarkable.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "Backyard feeder compilation: North Carolina yard, winter feeder setup. Filmed over 3 weeks. Species: dark-eyed junco flock (15-20 birds), Carolina wren pair (they always come together), red-bellied woodpecker claiming the suet cage, and one visit from a brown creeper (unusual for the feeder). Bird ID labels and behavior notes for each species."
- "Yellowstone wolf pack observation: Lamar Valley, watched the Wapiti Lake pack for 4 hours at dawn. Alpha female leading the pack across the valley, pups from this summer's litter following, one juvenile practicing hunting behavior on a raven. Show the landscape scale — tiny wolves against the enormous valley."
- "Humpback whale feeding, Alaska: Icy Strait Point, watched a group of 8 humpbacks bubble-net feeding cooperatively. Show the bubble ring appearing, the coordinated surfacing, the lunging mouths, the dive flukes. 45 minutes of footage from a zodiac."

## Workflow

1. Describe the species, behavior, location, and observation context
2. NemoVideo structures the wildlife narrative with documentary pacing
3. Species labels, behavior notes, and location context added automatically
4. Export with nature documentary-appropriate music and narration

## Tips for Best Results

- **Species-level specificity**: "Blackburnian warbler" not "orange bird" — wildlife content audiences know their species and reward specificity with engagement
- **Behavior is the story**: "alpha female leading the pack", "cooperative bubble-net feeding", "pup practicing hunting" — the behavior is more interesting than just the animal
- **Distance and context create scale**: "tiny wolves against the enormous Lamar Valley" or "80 yards from the bear family" — distance and landscape give the viewer the experience of being there
- **Observation ethics belong in the video**: How you observed without disturbing is part of the content — it models good wildlife ethics for your audience
- **Birder-level vs beginner**: Specify your audience — birders want scientific accuracy and subtle field marks; general nature lovers want accessible wonder

## Common Questions

**Can I create citizen science documentation with location and species data?**
Set `platform: "inaturalist"` and include GPS coordinates, observation date, and observer notes in the prompt. NemoVideo formats the output for scientific record-keeping alongside visual content.

**What if I only have a few seconds of the key wildlife moment?**
Describe the context around the moment (approach, setting, aftermath) and NemoVideo builds the full narrative around the key clip, using the brief footage as the centerpiece.

**How do I handle ethical wildlife content?**
Include your observation distance and method in the prompt. NemoVideo incorporates ethical observation context naturally — content that models good wildlife ethics performs better in nature communities.
