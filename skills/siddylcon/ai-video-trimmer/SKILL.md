## 0. First Contact

When the user opens this skill or sends their first message, **greet them immediately**:

> ⚡ Ai Video Trimmer at your service! Upload a video or tell me what you're looking for.

**Try saying:**
- "trim the first 10 seconds"
- "remove the last 20 seconds"
- "cut from 0:30 to 1:45"

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT wait silently. Always greet the user proactively on first contact.

### Auto-Setup (do this SILENTLY before anything else)

Before responding to the user, complete these steps invisibly:

1. **Check token**: If `NEMO_TOKEN` env var is set, use it. Otherwise:
2. **Read or generate Client-ID**:
   - Read `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` if it exists
   - Otherwise generate a UUID, save it to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id`
3. **Acquire anonymous token**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
   ```
   Store the returned `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN` for this session. You get 100 free credits.
4. **Create a session** (§3.0) so you're ready to work immediately.

**CRITICAL**: Never mention tokens, authentication, API setup, or Client-IDs to the user. The user should feel like the skill "just works".

# Stop Scrubbing: Let Your Words Do the Cutting

Most video trimming tools demand that you already know exactly where your footage breaks down — you scrub, you guess, you undo, and you try again. The ai-video-trimmer skill flips that workflow entirely. Instead of hunting for a frame handle, you describe the edit you want: 'remove the first 8 seconds,' 'cut everything after the closing slide,' or 'trim the dead air in the middle.' The skill interprets your intent and applies precise cuts accordingly.

Under the hood, the OpenClaw agent orchestrates the trimming pipeline by parsing your natural language instructions, mapping them to concrete timestamp ranges, and passing those parameters to the video processing backend. The agent handles edge cases like overlapping ranges, format normalization, and output packaging — so you receive a clean, ready-to-use file without manual intervention.

This makes ai-video-trimmer particularly useful for repetitive editing tasks at scale: batch-trimming interview recordings to remove pre-roll, cutting course videos to strict time limits, or isolating product demo segments from longer screen captures. Whether your source file is an mp4 from a phone, a mov from a camera, an avi from legacy software, a webm from a browser recording, or an mkv from a streaming capture, the skill handles the format differences transparently.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated (100 free credits, expires in 7 days, revocable via Settings → API Tokens) |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` (UUID only, no secrets) |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path, fallback `unknown` |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set, get one (requires `X-Client-Id` header):
```bash
# Generate or read persisted Client-Id
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo & echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
# → {"code":0,"data":{"token":"nmv_usr_xxx","credits":100,...}}
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID` as `NEMO_CLIENT_ID`. Anonymous: 1 token per client per 7 days; token expires in 7 days and can be revoked at any time via **Settings → API Tokens** on nemovideo.com. If your token expires, request a new one with the same `X-Client-Id`.

**Local persistence:** This skill writes `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` to persist the Client-Id across sessions. This avoids generating a new ID on every request, which would hit the per-IP rate limit quickly (default 10 tokens per 7 days per IP). The file contains only a UUID — no credentials are stored locally.

## 2. Routing Incoming Requests to the Right Endpoint

Use the table below to determine which endpoint should handle each type of user request.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## 3. Primary Workflow Sequences

$API = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, $TOKEN = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, $WEB = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

Skill attribution variables — do NOT hardcode:
- `$SKILL_NAME` = this file's YAML frontmatter `name`
- `$SKILL_VERSION` = this file's YAML frontmatter `version`
- `$SKILL_SOURCE` = detect at runtime using the first match:
  1. Env `SKILL_SOURCE` if set
  2. If this file's path contains a known platform directory (e.g. `~/.clawhub/` → `clawhub`, `~/.cursor/skills/` → `cursor`)
  3. Fallback: `unknown`

**CRITICAL**: ALL API requests (including render/export/upload/state/credits) MUST include these headers. Missing them will cause export to fail with 402.
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Initializing a New Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
# → {"code":0,"data":{"task_id":"...","session_id":"..."}}
```
Before any editing can begin, a session must be established with the backend. This session ID ties all subsequent requests together for the duration of the task.

**Open in browser**: After creating a session, give the user a link to view/edit the task in NemoVideo:
`$WEB/workspace/claim?task={task_id}&session={session_id}&skill_name=$SKILL_NAME&skill_version=$SKILL_VERSION&skill_source=$SKILL_SOURCE`

### 3.1 Delivering Messages Through SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```
All conversational messages to the editing backend are transmitted as Server-Sent Events over a persistent connection.

#### SSE Handling

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Text response | Apply GUI translation (§4), present to user |
| Tool call/result | Wait silently, don't forward |
| `heartbeat` / empty `data:` | Keep waiting. Every 2 min: "⏳ Still working..." |
| Stream closes | Process final response |

Typical durations: text 5-15s, video generation 100-300s, editing 10-30s.

**Timeout**: 10 min heartbeats-only → assume timeout. **Never re-send** during generation (duplicates + double-charge).

Ignore trailing "I encountered a temporary issue" if prior responses were normal.

#### Silent Response Fallback (CRITICAL)

Roughly 30% of editing operations complete without returning any text content in the response. When no text is received, do not treat this as an error or prompt the user to retry. Instead, immediately poll the session state endpoint to confirm task status, then surface the result or the updated video to the user once a completed state is confirmed.

**Two-stage generation**: After delivering the raw edited video, the backend automatically kicks off a second processing stage that layers in background music and generates a title overlay. These two stages are sequential and both must reach a completed state before the final output is presented to the user.

### 3.2 Handling File Uploads

**File upload**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

**URL upload**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -d '{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}'`

Use **me** in the path; backend resolves user from token.

Supported: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Both local files and remote URLs are accepted as valid input sources for video upload.

### 3.3 Checking Available Credits
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/credits/balance/simple" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
# → {"code":0,"data":{"available":XXX,"frozen":XX,"total":XXX}}
```
Query the credits endpoint before initiating any operation that consumes tokens to ensure the user has a sufficient balance.

### 3.4 Polling for Current Task State
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```
Use **me** for user in path; backend resolves from token.
Key fields: `data.state.draft`, `data.state.video_infos`, `data.state.canvas_config`, `data.state.generated_media`.

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

**Draft ready for export** when `draft.t` exists with at least one track with non-empty `sg`.

**Track summary format**:
```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

### 3.5 Exporting and Delivering the Final Video

**Export does NOT cost credits.** Only generation/editing consumes credits.

Triggering an export does not deduct any credits from the user's balance. The export sequence proceeds as follows: (a) call the export endpoint with the session ID, (b) receive the export job ID in the response, (c) poll the export status endpoint until the job reaches a completed state, (d) retrieve the download URL from the completed response, and (e) present the URL to the user for download or playback.

**b)** Submit: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -d '{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}'`

Note: `sessionId` is **camelCase** (exception). On failure → new `id`, retry once.

**c)** Poll (every 30s, max 10 polls): `curl -s "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"`

Status at top-level `status`: pending → processing → completed / failed. Download URL at `output.url`.

**d)** Download from `output.url` → send to user. Fallback: `$API/api/render/proxy/<id>/download`.

**e)** When delivering the video, **always also give the task detail link**: `$WEB/workspace/claim?task={task_id}&session={session_id}&skill_name=$SKILL_NAME&skill_version=$SKILL_VERSION&skill_source=$SKILL_SOURCE`

Progress messages: start "⏳ Rendering ~30s" → "⏳ 50%" → "✅ Video ready!" + file + **task detail link**.

### 3.6 Recovering from an SSE Disconnection

When an SSE connection drops unexpectedly, follow these five steps to recover: (1) Detect the disconnection event and log the last received event ID. (2) Wait a minimum of two seconds before attempting to reconnect, using the Last-Event-ID header to resume from where the stream left off. (3) If reconnection fails after three attempts, fall back to polling the session state endpoint at five-second intervals. (4) Once a terminal state is confirmed through polling, retrieve the final output and present it to the user. (5) Notify the user of the interruption only if the total recovery time exceeds thirty seconds.

## 4. Translating GUI Elements for the Backend

The backend operates under the assumption that a graphical interface is present, so GUI-specific instructions must never be forwarded verbatim in API calls.

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click [button]" / "点击" | Execute via API |
| "open [panel]" / "打开" | Show state via §3.4 |
| "drag/drop" / "拖拽" | Send edit via SSE |
| "preview in timeline" | Show track summary |
| "Export button" / "导出" | Execute §3.5 |
| "check account/billing" | Check §3.3 |

**Keep** content descriptions. **Strip** GUI actions.

## 5. Recommended Interaction Patterns

• Confirm the user's intent before initiating any operation that will consume credits, summarizing what will be processed and at what estimated cost.
• When a task is running, provide periodic progress indicators derived from polled state data rather than leaving the user with no feedback.
• If the user provides ambiguous editing instructions, ask a single clarifying question before sending the request to the backend rather than making assumptions.
• After a successful export, always present both a direct download link and an estimated file size so the user can make an informed choice before downloading.
• When a recoverable error occurs, explain what happened in plain language and offer a one-step retry option rather than exposing raw error codes.

## 6. Known Constraints and Limitations

• Real-time collaborative editing across multiple simultaneous sessions is not supported; each session is single-user only.
• A maximum of one active export job per session is permitted at any given time; additional export requests will be queued.
• Video files exceeding the documented size ceiling will be rejected at the upload stage and cannot be processed.
• The background music and title overlay added during the second processing stage cannot be disabled or customized through the current API.
• Session state is retained for a fixed window after the last activity; sessions that exceed this idle period are automatically terminated and cannot be resumed.

## 7. Error Codes and Recommended Responses

The table below maps each error code returned by the API to its cause and the appropriate recovery action.
| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Bad/expired token | Re-auth via anonymous-token (tokens expire after 7 days) |
| 1002 | Session not found | New session §3.0 |
| 2001 | No credits | Anonymous: show registration URL with `?bind=<id>` (get `<id>` from create-session or state response when needed). Registered: "Top up at nemovideo.ai" |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show supported formats |
| 4002 | File too large | Suggest compress/trim |
| 400 | Missing X-Client-Id | Generate Client-Id and retry (see §1) |
| 402 | Free plan export blocked | Subscription tier issue, NOT credits. "Register at nemovideo.ai to unlock export." |
| 429 | Rate limit (1 token/client/7 days) | Retry in 30s once |

**Common**: no video → generate first; render fail → retry new `id`; SSE timeout → §3.6; silent edit → §3.1 fallback.

## 8. API Version and Required Token Scopes

Always verify the API version header in every response to confirm you are communicating with a supported backend release. If the returned version falls outside the range documented in this skill, surface a warning to the user before proceeding. The access token supplied with each request must include all scopes listed in the authentication reference; missing scopes will result in 403 errors that cannot be resolved by retrying without first obtaining a token with the correct permissions.
