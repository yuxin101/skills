# FPS Highlight Video Maker — Create First-Person Shooter Clip and Montage Content

Describe your best FPS plays and NemoVideo creates the video. CS2 aces, Valorant clutches, Apex Legends squad wipes, Warzone final circle wins — narrate the play, the weapon, the context, and the outcome, and get an FPS highlight that communicates your skill to everyone who plays the game.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for FPS-specific gaming content:
- Create clutch round and ace highlight clips for tactical FPS games (CS2, Valorant)
- Film squad play and coordination highlights in battle royale games
- Build weapon mastery and skill demonstration content
- Document ranked climb milestones with the highlight plays that got you there
- Create "how I do it" educational content breaking down the play for viewers
- Produce FPS channel montage content with music-synced kills

## How to Describe Your FPS Highlight

Be specific about the game, the weapon, the tactical situation, and what made the play impressive.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "Valorant Operator highlight: one-shot, one-kill style. Played as Jett on Breeze, activated dash to peak A main, one-tapped first player mid-air, reset immediately, peaked again from a different angle, one-tapped the second. Both kills were in under 3 seconds. The third player swung expecting a reload and got one-tapped. Three kills with Operator in 4 seconds while dashing."
- "Apex Legends squad wipe on final ring: three squads converged at the same time, we were the last full squad standing. I popped off with an R-99, my duo partner used Caustic gas to separate them, and our third cleaned up with a Mastiff. We won the game. Show the chaos, the squad coordination, and the win screen."
- "CS2 AWP montage from 3 months of ranked play: 12 clips, all long-range picks, no close-range spam. Show the prefire through smokes, the noscopes that landed, the double-peek one-tap, and the 4k from CT side Mirage. BGM synced to kills."

Three players pushed at once — got the first headshot through the smoke on banana, repositioned to B site, prefired the door and got the second mid-movement, then 1v1 on B with 12 HP. The last guy had an AK-47. Peaked aggressively, hit the headshot before he could spray. We were down 12-14, this clutch extended to 13-14. Show the play in real time first, then slow motion on each kill, then back to real time for the final 1v1.",

## Tips for Best Results

- **FPS community speaks weapon**: "Deagle headshot" means something different from "pistol kill" — use the actual weapon name and the play communicates instantly to people who play the game
- **Tactical context is the story**: "1v3 anti-eco" or "1v4 with 12 HP" tells viewers the odds before the play begins — the difficulty context is what makes the highlight impressive
- **Slow motion on the key peak**: Set `slow_motion_kills: true` for pistol clutches and no-scope moments — the mechanics that look effortless in real-time are clearly skilled in slow motion
- **Crosshair placement is the skill indicator**: Set `show_crosshair: true` — experienced FPS players watch the crosshair to assess pre-aim and game sense, not just whether the shot landed
- **Music-synced montages are the format**: For multi-clip montages, `music_style: "synced_kills"` — kills that land on beat drops are the definitive FPS montage format

## Common Questions

**What FPS games work best with this skill?**
Any FPS — CS2, Valorant, Apex Legends, Warzone, R6 Siege, Overwatch 2, Halo Infinite. Mention the specific game and NemoVideo uses the correct UI overlays and game-specific terminology.

**Can I create educational content breaking down the play?**
Yes — describe "show each kill with a slow-motion breakdown explaining the read (why I peeked when I did)" and set `duration_seconds: 60`. FPS educational content performs well on YouTube with the demographic that wants to improve.

**Should I use music or game audio for clutch clips?**
For single clutch clips, `music_style: "no_music"` often works better — the in-game audio (kill sounds, utility pops, heavy breathing) creates its own tension. For montages, use `synced_kills`.
