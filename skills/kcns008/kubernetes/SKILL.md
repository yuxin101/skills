# Cluster Agent Swarm — Complete Platform Operations

## Runtime Requirements

This skill package provides Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster management capabilities. Credentials are **modular** - only configure what you need for your specific use case.

### Always Required
| Requirement | Description | Environment Variable |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Kubeconfig** | Valid kubeconfig with cluster access | `KUBECONFIG` or `~/.kube/config` |
| **kubectl** | Kubernetes CLI | Must be in PATH |

### Conditional - Enable Only As Needed

| Platform | Enable If... | Credentials |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **AWS/EKS/ROSA** | Managing AWS-hosted Kubernetes | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| **Azure/ARO** | Managing Azure-hosted Kubernetes | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID` |
| **GCP/GKE** | Managing GCP-hosted Kubernetes | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` |
| **ArgoCD** | Using GitOps agent | `ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ARGOCD_SERVER` |
| **Vault** | Using secrets management | `VAULT_TOKEN` |
| **GitHub** | Pushing to git repositories | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |

### Session Setup
Before using the agents, you **MUST** set up a session context:
```bash
# Set up session context for your environment
bash skills/orchestrator/scripts/setup-session.sh <environment> [context-name]

# Environments: dev, qa, staging, prod
# Note: prod requires human approval for all modifications
```

### Security Considerations
- Agents operate with **least privilege** by default
- All credential access is logged
- Production modifications require human approval
- Secrets are never logged or stored in code

---

## Security Assessment - Read Before Installing

### Source Verification
- This skill pulls code from a **third-party GitHub repository**
- **Verify the source URL** before installing: `https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills`
- **Pin to a specific version** - never use `main` branch in production:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills.git
  cd cluster-agent-swarm-skills
  git fetch --tags
  git checkout v1.0.0  # Use verified release tag or commit hash
  ```

### Third-Party Script Execution Warning
- This is a **scripted skill** - it will write executable bash scripts to disk
- Scripts perform cluster operations including: deployments, scaling, scanning, configuration
- **Some scripts can be destructive** - review before running:
  - Scripts with `-delete`, `-cleanup` in name may remove resources
  - Scripts with `-promote`, `-deploy` modify cluster state
- Always test in non-production first

### Install Mechanism
- Installing via `npx skills add` downloads and executes code from GitHub
- The skill cannot verify integrity of external scripts
- **Audit all scripts locally** before running in production
- Consider maintaining a verified, offline copy of trusted scripts

### Persistence & Blast Radius
- Agents maintain **persistent state** across sessions via:
  - `WORKING.md` - session progress tracking
  - `LOGS.md` - action audit trail
  - `MEMORY.md` - long-term learnings
- Agents are configured to **commit changes** to these files as part of normal operation
- This persistence increases blast radius if misused - limit repository write access if concerned

### Human Approval Enforcement
- The skill documentation **claims** human approval required for production changes
- **This is a procedural control, NOT a technical enforcement**
- Your platform **MUST enforce** an approval gate before allowing production operations
- Do not rely on agent self-restriction for production safety

### Principle of Least Privilege - Required
- **DO NOT** provide owner/root-level cloud credentials
- Create dedicated, minimal-permission service accounts for:
  - Kubernetes namespace-level access (not cluster-admin)
  - AWS IAM roles with limited EKS permissions
  - Azure service principals with limited subscription access
  - GCP service accounts with limited project permissions
- **Never provide production credentials** until you have audited the code in non-production

### Sandbox Before Production
1. Run this skill in an **isolated/non-production environment first**
2. Manually step through scripts to understand their behavior
3. Pay special attention to:
   - `*-cleanup.sh` scripts - may delete resources
   - `*-promote.sh` scripts - may promote artifacts
   - `*-delete.sh` scripts - explicitly destructive
4. Verify no unexpected network calls to external endpoints

### Supply Chain Tools
- Scripts may download binaries (syft, cosign, trivy, etc.)
- **Only allow downloads from trusted release sources** (official GitHub releases, package managers)
- Consider curating offline toolchains if your environment requires it

access to ALL 7 specialized agents working together as a coordinated swarm.

## Installation

### Install All Skills (Recommended)
```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills
```

This installs all 7 agents as a single combined skill with access to all capabilities.

### Install Individual Skills

Each agent can be installed separately using GitHub tree paths:

```bash
# Orchestrator - Jarvis (task routing, coordination)

# Observability - Pulse (metrics, alerts, incidents)
npx skills add https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills/tree/main/skills/observability

# Artifacts - Cache (registries, SBOM, promotions)
npx skills add https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills/tree/main/skills/artifacts

# Developer Experience - Desk (namespaces, onboarding)
npx skills add https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills/tree/main/skills/developer-experience
```

> **Note:** Always pin to a specific tag/commit in production. See Security Assessment section.

## Agent Capabilities Summary

### What Agents CAN Do
- Read cluster state (`kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, `oc get`)
- Deploy via GitOps (`argocd app sync`, Flux reconciliation)
- Create documentation and reports
- Investigate and triage incidents
- Provision standard resources (namespaces, quotas, RBAC)
- Run health checks and audits
- Scan images and generate SBOMs
- Query metrics and logs
- Execute pre-approved runbooks

### What Agents CANNOT Do (Human-in-the-Loop Required)
- Delete production resources (`kubectl delete` in prod)
- Modify cluster-wide policies (NetworkPolicy, OPA, Kyverno cluster policies)
- Make direct changes to secrets without rotation workflow
- Modify network routes or service mesh configuration
- Scale beyond defined resource limits
- Perform irreversible cluster upgrades
- Approve production deployments (can prepare, human approves)
- Change RBAC at cluster-admin level

---

## Communication Patterns

### @Mentions
Agents communicate via @mentions in shared task comments:
```
@Shield Please review the RBAC for payment-service v3.2 before I sync.
@Pulse Is the CPU spike related to the deployment or external traffic?
@Atlas The staging cluster needs 2 more worker nodes.
```

### Thread Subscriptions
- Commenting on a task → auto-subscribe
- Being @mentioned → auto-subscribe
- Being assigned → auto-subscribe
- Once subscribed → receive ALL future comments on heartbeat

### Escalation Path
1. Agent detects issue
2. Agent attempts resolution within guardrails
3. If blocked → @mention another agent or escalate to human
4. P1 incidents → all relevant agents auto-notified

---

## Heartbeat Schedule

Agents wake on staggered 5-minute intervals:
```
*/5  * * * *  Atlas   (Cluster Ops - needs fast response for incidents)
*/5  * * * *  Pulse   (Observability - needs fast response for alerts)
*/5  * * * *  Shield  (Security - fast response for CVEs and threats)
*/10 * * * *  Flow    (GitOps - deployments can wait a few minutes)
*/10 * * * *  Cache   (Artifacts - promotions are scheduled)
*/15 * * * *  Desk    (DevEx - developer requests aren't usually urgent)
*/15 * * * *  Orchestrator (Coordination - overview and standups)
```

---

## Key Principles

- **Roles over genericism** — Each agent has a defined SOUL with exactly who they are
- **Files over mental notes** — Only files persist between sessions
- **Staggered schedules** — Don't wake all agents at once
- **Shared context** — One source of truth for tasks and communication
- **Heartbeat, not always-on** — Balance responsiveness with cost
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Critical actions require approval
- **Guardrails over freedom** — Define what agents can and cannot do
- **Audit everything** — Every action logged to activity feed
- **Reliability first** — System stability always wins over new features
- **Security by default** — Deny access, approve by exception
