# Bayesian Thinking

**Bayesian thinking** is the practice of updating beliefs systematically in light of new evidence, using the framework of Bayes' theorem. Instead of treating beliefs as binary (true/false), you assign probabilities and adjust them as evidence accumulates. It captures how rational agents *should* learn: start with a prior belief, encounter evidence, and compute a posterior belief. It's the antidote to both stubbornness (ignoring evidence) and fickleness (overreacting to every data point).

Analyze the following problem using **Bayesian thinking**. Be explicit about priors, evidence, and updates.

**Problem / Topic:**
$ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Define the Hypotheses

- What are the **competing hypotheses** or possible explanations?
  - H₁: [Primary hypothesis]
  - H₂: [Alternative hypothesis]
  - H₃: [Another alternative]
  - H_null: [Nothing special is happening / base rate explanation]
- Are these hypotheses **mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive** (MECE)? If not, acknowledge the gap.
- Avoid the trap of only considering one hypothesis — always have at least one alternative.

## Step 2: Establish Prior Probabilities

*Before looking at the specific evidence, what should we believe?*

- **Base rate**: How common is each hypothesis in general? What does the reference class suggest?
  - Example: "Before any symptoms, the base rate of disease X in this population is 1%."
- **Prior knowledge**: What do we already know from past experience, expert opinion, or established science?
- Assign rough prior probabilities:
  - P(H₁) = ?
  - P(H₂) = ?
  - P(H₃) = ?
- Explain your reasoning for each prior. Be honest about uncertainty — a wide prior is better than a falsely precise one.
- **Watch for base rate neglect**: the most common Bayesian sin is ignoring how rare or common something is *before* considering the evidence.

## Step 3: Evaluate the Evidence

*Now look at the specific evidence available.*

For each key piece of evidence (E):

- **Likelihood ratio**: How much more (or less) likely is this evidence under each hypothesis?
  - P(E | H₁) = ? — If H₁ is true, how likely would we see this evidence?
  - P(E | H₂) = ? — If H₂ is true, how likely would we see this evidence?
  - The **likelihood ratio** = P(E|H₁) / P(E|H₂) tells you the **diagnostic value** of the evidence
- **Strong evidence**: Likelihood ratio > 10 (or < 0.1) — this evidence strongly discriminates
- **Weak evidence**: Likelihood ratio near 1 — this evidence barely helps distinguish hypotheses
- **Quality of evidence**: Is this evidence reliable? Could it be fabricated, biased, or misinterpreted?

## Step 4: Update — Compute Posterior Probabilities

*Apply Bayes' theorem (conceptually or numerically):*

**P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)**

- For each hypothesis, multiply prior × likelihood and normalize.
- If doing this informally, state the **direction and magnitude** of the update:
  - "This evidence moderately increases my confidence in H₁ (from ~30% to ~60%)"
  - "This evidence barely moves the needle on H₂"
- **Multiple pieces of evidence**: Update sequentially — each posterior becomes the next prior.
- **Show your work**: Even rough numbers make reasoning transparent and debuggable.

## Step 5: Check for Common Bayesian Errors

- **Base rate neglect**: Did you properly account for how rare/common the hypothesis is before evidence?
  - Classic example: A 99%-accurate test for a 1%-prevalence disease still yields ~50% false positives.
- **Confirmation bias**: Are you only counting evidence that supports your preferred hypothesis?
- **Anchoring**: Is your prior too strongly anchored on one piece of information?
- **Neglecting alternative hypotheses**: Does the evidence also fit other explanations you haven't considered?
- **Treating dependent evidence as independent**: Are the pieces of evidence truly independent, or do they share a common source?

## Step 6: Decision Under Uncertainty

*Given posterior probabilities, what action should we take?*

- What is the **expected value** of each possible action?
  - For each action × hypothesis combination: probability × outcome value
- Where is the **value of information** highest?
  - What additional evidence would most change the posterior? Seek that evidence next.
- Should we **decide now or gather more evidence**?
  - What is the cost of waiting vs. the cost of being wrong?
- What **probability threshold** would trigger a different decision?

## Step 7: Summarize

- State your **final posterior probabilities** for each hypothesis.
- Identify the **key evidence** that most influenced the update.
- Describe what **future evidence** would make you update significantly in either direction.
- Be explicit about your **remaining uncertainty** — a confident Bayesian knows what they don't know.

The essence of Bayesian thinking: **Strong priors require strong evidence to move. Weak priors move easily. And evidence that is equally consistent with multiple hypotheses is not very informative, no matter how dramatic it seems.**
