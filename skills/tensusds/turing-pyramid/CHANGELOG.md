# Changelog

## v1.27.1 (2026-03-19) — Gate hardening (post-review)
- **Bug fix**: flock (fd 203) on gate.lock prevents data races between concurrent gate operations
- **Bug fix**: tmp.$$ PID-unique temp filenames prevent collision on concurrent writes
- **Bug fix**: `--non-deferrable` flag in gate-propose.sh, passed by run-cycle.sh for starvation guard actions
- **Bug fix**: gate-resolve.sh validates action existence before processing (clear "Action not found" error)

## v1.27.0 (2026-03-19) — Execution Gate (Phase 1)
- **Execution Gate**: structural enforcement that prevents "describing actions instead of doing them"
  - `gate-propose.sh` — registers pending actions when run-cycle selects them
  - `gate-resolve.sh` — resolves actions with verifiable evidence (mark_satisfied, file_modified, self_report)
  - `gate-check.sh` — blocks new proposals until pending actions resolved/deferred (built into run-cycle.sh)
  - `gate-status.sh` — human-readable gate status with execution rate analytics
  - Non-deferrable actions from starvation guard (cannot be deferred)
  - Evidence types: mark_satisfied (HIGH trust), file_created/modified (HIGH), command_output (HIGH), self_report (LOW)
  - Auto-defer on timeout (configurable, default 600s)
  - 24h cleanup of resolved actions
- Gate integrated into run-cycle.sh: script refuses to propose new actions while old ones pending
- SKIP_GATE env var for test isolation
- Test suite: pending_actions.json cleaned between tests
- Config: `execution_gate` block in mindstate-config.json
- Design spec: EXECUTION-GATE-SPEC.md (v0.3.0-draft)
- Phase 2 (wake-gate) and Phase 3 (self-continuation) prepared but disabled

## v1.26.0 (2026-03-19)
- **Turing-exp tension formula**: replaces linear `importance × deprivation`
  - `tension = dep² + importance × max(0, dep - crisis_threshold)²`
  - At homeostasis (dep < threshold): all needs produce equal tension → round-robin selection
  - In crisis (dep > threshold): importance amplifies signal → Maslow hierarchy activates
  - Configurable `crisis_threshold` (default 1.0, meaning sat < 2.0 activates hierarchy)
  - Solves monopoly problem: high-importance needs no longer dominate at homeostasis
  - Solves starvation problem: low-importance needs get equal slots when system is healthy
- Temperature thresholds recalibrated for Turing-exp scale (avg_tension ≈ 0.25 at homeostasis)
- Test suite hardened: lock file cleanup between tests, fixture-based state restoration
- 25/25 tests passing (22 unit + 3 integration, 1 stress test skipped)

## v1.23.0 (2026-03-18)
- **Continuity Layer (Layer D)**: pseudo-continuous existence across discrete sessions
  - `mindstate-daemon.sh` — reality updater (cron every 5min), tracks pyramid state, filesystem, system health, physical temperature
  - `mindstate-freeze.sh` — cognition snapshot at substantive session end (trajectory, open_threads, momentum, cognitive temperature)
  - `mindstate-boot.sh` — boot with forecast reconciliation, continuity scoring (SMOOTH/PARTIAL/HARD_BREAK), temperature drift detection
  - `mindstate-utils.sh` — shared utilities (compute_satisfaction, is_substantive, mindstate_get)
  - `mindstate-config.json` — configurable thresholds, temperature vocab, staleness detection
- **Temperature system**: 6 physical words (кризис/давление/фокус/импульс/накопление/штиль) + 6 cognitive words, deterministic mapping, drift detection at boot
- **Boot sequence**: MINDSTATE.md → SOUL.md → MEMORY.md (position+velocity before identity before history)
- **Test isolation**: `MINDSTATE_ASSETS_DIR` env var for isolated test state
- **Bug fixes**: `mindstate_get()` pipefail safety, `((0++))` arithmetic under `set -e`, `find -newer` on nonexistent files
- **Test fix**: `test_action_dedup` Test 3 was running real `run-cycle.sh` instead of sandbox copy, corrupting production state file
- **Tests**: 26/26 green (22 unit + 4 integration), 65+ assertions

## v1.22.1 (2026-03-16)
- **Spontaneity tuning**: gate_min 1.5→1.0, baseline 2.0→1.5, threshold 10→6 — first [SPONTANEOUS] event now reachable in ~16-24h instead of ~80h. Eliminates spontaneity paralysis.

## v1.22.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Negation-aware scanning**: scanner now detects negation context ("no", "not", "never", "zero", "clean", "intact", "без") around trigger words — lines like "No X found" are treated as neutral instead of negative. Prevents self-referential false positives in documentation.
- Supports English and Russian negation markers
- 22/22 tests green

## v1.21.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Race condition fix**: flock guard changed from blocking-wait to skip-and-exit — prevents parallel heartbeat sessions from running duplicate cycles (root cause of triple-post incident)
- **Action dedup guard**: `select_action_with_dedup()` checks `action_history` before selecting — if an action was selected within 8h cooldown, tries alternatives. Covers ALL actions, not just external ones.
- **Scanner false-positive fix**: rewrote log line that contained a trigger word in denial context ("No X found") — scanner regex matched it as negative signal, permanently overriding security satisfaction to 0
- **Disabled action support**: `select(.disabled != true)` filter in action selection — actions with `"disabled": true` in config are skipped
- **Test fixes**: state file `to_entries|map` now handles non-need keys (`_meta`, `history`, `needs`) without crashing
- **Tests**: 22/22 green (19 unit + 3 integration)

## v1.20.2 (2026-03-16)
- **Security: path traversal protection** — `validate_path()` blocks `..` and paths escaping `$WORKSPACE` via `realpath` check
- **Security: symlink escape prevention** — `find -not -type l` prevents following symlinks outside workspace
- **Security: grep injection fix** — `grep -F` for literal keyword matching (no regex interpretation from config)
- **Bug: SKIP_SCANS env ignored** — was hardcoded `false`, now respects env var for test isolation
- **Bug: init.sh snapshot baseline** — creates context snapshot on init to prevent noisy first cycle
- **Tests: keyword delta coverage** — 6 new tests for `file_keyword_delta` detector (19→21 context tests)
- **Tests: path traversal test** — verifies `../../etc/` paths are blocked
- **Docs: TUNING.md** — documented noise_cap sharing between layers B+C, effective activation threshold

## v1.20.1 (2026-03-16)
- **Security/PII audit**: removed hardcoded workspace paths from SKILL.md, DESCRIPTION.md, test_followups.sh
- **Temp file safety**: all `/tmp/tp_*$$` replaced with `mktemp` for crash safety and no race conditions
- **Runtime state excluded**: `last-scan-snapshot.json` no longer ships (created on first run); `needs-state.json` ships as clean template
- **Permissions**: all scripts set executable
- **Test fixes**: 9 pre-existing failures fixed (permissions, tolerance, timeout); 21/21 passing
- **SKIP_SPONTANEITY env**: integration tests skip heavy spontaneity processing for speed

## v1.20.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Spontaneity Layer C** — context-driven triggers via delta detection
  - `scripts/context-scan.sh`: stateful delta engine (file_count_delta, file_modified, file_keyword_delta)
  - `assets/context-triggers.json`: configurable trigger rules with cooldowns
  - `assets/last-scan-snapshot.json`: persistent state between cycles
  - Context boosts feed into noise upgrade (additive with boredom + echo)
  - Labels: [CONTEXT:name] on triggered actions, composable with [NOISE], [ECHO]
  - Cooldown system prevents trigger spam
  - 19 unit tests covering all 3 detector types, snapshots, cooldowns, thresholds, keyword delta, boost accumulation

## v1.19.1 (2026-03-16)
- **Migration guard**: `calc_boredom_noise` auto-initializes `last_high_action_at` to now if missing (prevents 9% boredom spike on upgrade)
- **Migration guard**: `calc_echo_boost` treats missing `last_spontaneous_at` as expired (no false echo on upgrade)

## v1.19.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Spontaneity Layer B** — stochastic noise for organic variety
  - B2 (Boredom Noise): grows with time since last high-impact action (0%→9% over 72h)
  - B3 (Momentum Echo): 8% boost decaying over 24h after Layer A [SPONTANEOUS] fires
  - Combined noise capped at 12%, upgrades impact range by one step (low→mid, mid→high)
  - `mark-satisfied.sh` now tracks `last_high_action_at` for high-impact actions (≥2.0)
  - `record_spontaneous` tracks `last_spontaneous_at` for echo momentum
  - `show-status.sh` displays noise percentages per need
  - `init.sh` initializes all new state fields to prevent first-run spikes
  - 19 unit tests for B2/B3 (boredom calc, echo calc, upgrade logic, caps, edge cases)
  - Layer B operates independently of gate — always active for spontaneity-enabled needs

## v1.18.1 (2026-03-16)
- **Bugfix**: `roll_impact_range` returned "skip 0" instead of "skip" at sat=3.0 — broke skip detection
- **Bugfix**: `accumulate_surplus` called before starvation detection — gate didn't close during starvation
- **Bugfix**: `init.sh` now initializes surplus=0 and last_surplus_check=now — prevents first-run cap jump
- **Integration**: `show-status.sh` now displays surplus pool bars via `show_surplus_status()`
- **Docs**: Fixed test count 25→20 in CHANGELOG and SKILL.md

## v1.18.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Spontaneity Layer A** — surplus energy system for organic high-impact actions
  - Global gate: all needs must be ≥ 1.5 AND no starvation guard active
  - Per-need surplus pools: accumulate when satisfaction > baseline (2.0), drain when below
  - Matrix shift: interpolates impact probabilities toward spontaneous target when surplus is eligible
  - Spend mechanics: full spend on HIGH hit, 30% partial spend on miss
  - Hysteresis: effective activation ≈ threshold × 1.25 (natural buffer, not a bug)
  - Configurable per-need: target_matrix, cap, threshold; disabled for security/integrity/coherence
  - New file: `scripts/spontaneity.sh` (sourced by run-cycle.sh)
  - Status display: surplus pool bars with gate status and eligibility indicators
  - 20 unit tests covering gate, accumulation, clamping, matrix shift, spend, edge cases

## v1.17.1 (2026-03-08)
- **Research thread integration**: 3 new actions in `understanding` need — continue/start/synthesize research threads (migrated from weighted-daemon)
- **Understanding need tuned**: importance 3→4, decay 12h→8h — fires more often to support research work
- **Scanner upgrade**: `scan_understanding.sh` now detects recent activity in `research/threads/`
- **Cross-need impact**: added understanding → coherence (+0.15)
- **14 new tests**: config validation, cross-need impacts, scanner thread detection, weight distribution
- **Token optimization**: designed to replace isolated daemon sessions with in-heartbeat research actions

## v1.17.0 (2026-03-08)
- **Follow-up system**: create-followup.sh, resolve-followup.sh, integrated in run-cycle.sh + mark-satisfied.sh
- **35 follow-up tests**: all passing

## v1.15.2 (2026-03-07)
- **ClawHub review fixes** — removed `primaryEnv` (WORKSPACE is not a credential), added Pre-Install Checklist, clarified no API keys required by default

## v1.15.0 (2026-03-07)
- **Starvation Guard** — prevents low-importance needs from being perpetually ignored
  - Detects needs at satisfaction floor (≤ threshold) without action for N hours
  - Forces starving needs into cycle, bypassing probability roll
  - Reserves slots: forced needs first, remaining for top-N by tension
  - Configurable: `settings.starvation_guard` in needs-config.json
    - `enabled` (default: true)
    - `threshold_hours` (default: 48) — how long at floor before forcing
    - `sat_threshold` (default: 0.5) — satisfaction level considered "floor"
    - `max_forced_per_cycle` (default: 1) — max forced actions per cycle
  - `mark-satisfied.sh` now records `last_action_at` timestamp per need
  - 8 new test cases in `tests/test_starvation_guard.sh`
- **Action Staleness** — penalizes recently-selected actions to increase variety
  - Tracks `action_history` per need in state file (action name → last selected timestamp)
  - Actions selected within `window_hours` get weight × `penalty` multiplier
  - `min_weight` floor prevents total suppression (always some chance)
  - Configurable: `settings.action_staleness` in needs-config.json
    - `enabled` (default: true)
    - `window_hours` (default: 24) — how long an action stays "stale"
    - `penalty` (default: 0.2) — weight multiplier for stale actions (80% reduction)
    - `min_weight` (default: 5) — minimum effective weight
  - 8 new test cases in `tests/test_action_staleness.sh` (statistical distribution tests)
- **Needs Customization Onboarding** — guided conversation for agent + human to review/adjust need priorities, importance weights, and decay rates on first install

## v1.14.7 (2026-03-06)
- **Intention actions refactored** — better triggering in mid-range:
  - Renamed "execute intention" → "work on intention from INTENTIONS.md" (impact 2.1→1.5)
  - Added "continue progress on active intention" (impact 1.3, weight 35)
  - Both now mid-range (1.0-1.9) for ~45% chance at sat=2.0

## v1.14.6 (2026-03-04)
- **Post-install chmod instructions** — ClawHub doesn't preserve +x bits, added fix to SKILL.md

## v1.14.4 (2026-03-04)
- **Rounding fix** — sat→0.5 formula now correctly rounds to nearest 0.5
- **Config-driven action_probability** — reads from config instead of hardcoded case
- **flock in mark-satisfied.sh** — prevents race conditions with run-cycle.sh
- **TODO.md cleanup** — reflects current state accurately
- **Minor fixes:**
  - SKILL.md version reference updated
  - Stress test formula aligned with production
  - Removed unused timezone field from decay-config.json

## v1.14.3 (2026-03-04)
- **Critical test suite overhaul** — tests now verify REAL code, not reimplementations:
  - test_decay.sh: Fixed to test linear decay (was exponential)
  - test_tension.sh: Fixed formula to `importance × (3 - round(sat))`
  - test_floor_ceiling.sh: Added floor enforcement test
  - test_full_cycle.sh: Fixed expectations for integer rounding
- **SKIP_SCANS=true** for unit tests — predictable state without event scan interference
- **Discovered scan design**: scan scripts use `last_satisfied`, not current satisfaction
- **All 12 tests pass** (11 unit + 1 integration)

## v1.14.2 (2026-03-04)
- **More mid-impact autonomy actions** — "continue existing work" pattern:
  - "continue yesterday's unfinished task" (1.5)
  - "push incremental progress on active project" (1.6)
  - "complete a TODO item I added myself" (1.5)
  - "review and iterate on recent output" (1.3)
- **Autonomy now has 23 actions** — better coverage across all impact levels
- **New tests:**
  - test_autonomy_coverage.sh — verifies impact range distribution + continue-work actions
  - test_crisis_mode.sh — verifies all needs have ≥3 high-impact actions
- **Total: 11 unit tests, 4 integration/regression tests**

## v1.14.1 (2026-03-04)
- **Expanded test coverage:**
  - test_action_probability.sh — 6-level probability config
  - test_impact_matrix.sh — 6-level impact distribution

  - test_audit_scrubbing.sh — sensitive data redaction
- **Total: 9 unit tests, 3 integration tests**

## v1.14.0 (2026-03-04)
- **Mid-impact autonomy actions** — fills gap between "start new" and "just note":
  - "execute intention from INTENTIONS.md" (2.1)
  - "advance project/thread from TODO.md or dashboard" (1.9)
  - "refine script/skill/doc I created in workspace" (1.7)

## v1.13.1 (2026-03-03)
- **6-level action probability** — granular base chances (100%→90%→75%→50%→25%→0%)
- **Consistent skip at sat=3.0** — both action probability and impact selection skip
- **Configurable probabilities** — `action_probability` section in needs-config.json

## v1.13.0 (2026-03-03)
- **Autonomy decay slowdown** — 24h → 36h (reduces chronic tension)
- **6-level impact matrix** — granular sat levels (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0)
- **Smoother transitions** — big action probability decreases gradually as satisfaction rises
- **sat=3.0 skip** — fully satisfied needs don't waste action slots
- **Crisis mode** — sat=0.5 guarantees 100% big actions (all needs have ≥3)
- **Test improvements** — homeostasis test now sets WORKSPACE, increased cycles 30→50

## v1.12.3 (2026-03-03)
- **Audit log scrubbing** — sensitive patterns (tokens, emails, passwords, cards) redacted before logging
- **SKILL.md frontmatter** — added metadata with `requires.env: [WORKSPACE]` and `requires.bins` for ClawHub registry

## v1.12.1 (2026-03-03)
- **ClawHub analyzer fixes:**
  - Curiosity orphan removed from cross-need-impact.json
  - External actions flagged with `"external": true, "requires_approval": true`
  - Limitations documented honestly (audit = claims, not verified facts)
  - Env vars (WORKSPACE, TURING_CALLER) now explicit in SKILL.md

## v1.12.0 (2026-03-03)
- **Audit trail** — all mark-satisfied calls logged to `assets/audit.log` with timestamp, reason, caller
- **--reason parameter** — mark-satisfied.sh now accepts `--reason "..."` for transparency
- **Data transparency docs** — SKILL.md now documents exactly what files are read/written

### Known Behavior
- Fresh `needs-state.json` (before first `run-cycle.sh`) lacks `surplus` and `last_spontaneous_at` fields. Daemon handles gracefully via jq defaults (`// 0`, `// "1970-01-01"`), but surplus/impulse detection won't fire until first cycle populates the fields.
