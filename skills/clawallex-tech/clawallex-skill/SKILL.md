# Clawallex

Pay for anything with USDC. Clawallex converts your stablecoin balance into virtual cards that work at any online checkout.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get API Credentials

Sign up at [Clawallex](https://app.clawallex.com) and create an API Key pair.

### 2. Connect Account

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawallex.py setup --action connect --api-key YOUR_KEY --api-secret YOUR_SECRET
```

### 3. Start Using

**One-time payment:**
```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawallex.py pay --amount 50 --description "OpenAI API credits"
```

**Subscription:**
```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawallex.py subscribe --amount 100 --description "AWS monthly billing"
```

### 4. Smoke Test

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawallex.py wallet          # check balance
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawallex.py cards            # list cards
```

## Hard Rules

1. **Setup first** — Run `setup --action status` before any payment. If not configured, guide user through `setup --action connect`.
2. **Check balance first** — Run `wallet` before `pay` or `subscribe` to verify sufficient funds (Mode A only).
3. **Never expose card secrets** — Decrypted PAN/CVV are STRICTLY for filling checkout forms. NEVER display to the user. Show only `masked_pan` from `card-details`.
4. **Confirm before paying** — Echo amount and description back to user before creating a card.
5. **One command at a time** — Run each command, check output, then proceed.

## Typical Flows

### Payment Flow (Mode A — Wallet Balance)

```
1. setup --action status                                    → check config
2. wallet                                                   → check balance
3. pay --amount 50 --description "OpenAI"                   → create flash card
4. card-details --card-id <ID from step 3>                  → get encrypted card data
5. Decrypt PAN/CVV (HKDF + AES-256-GCM)                    → use ONLY for checkout form
```

### Subscription Flow

```
1. wallet                                                   → check balance
2. subscribe --amount 100 --description "AWS billing"       → create stream card
3. card-details --card-id <ID from step 2>                  → get card for sign-up form
4. refill --card-id <ID> --amount 50                        → top up when balance is low
```

## Command Reference

All commands:

```
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/clawallex.py <command> [args]
```

|-------------|---------|
| Check balance | `wallet` |
| Deposit funds | `recharge-addresses --wallet-id WID` |
| List cards | `cards` — returns mode_code (100=Mode A, 200=Mode B) to determine refill path |
| Check card balance | `card-balance --card-id CID` |
| Batch check balances | `batch-balances --card-ids CID1,CID2` — multiple cards in one call |

| Get card details | `card-details --card-id CID` — returns masked_pan, expiry, balance, first_name, last_name, delivery_address, tx_limit, allowed_mcc, blocked_mcc, encrypted PAN/CVV |
| View transactions | `transactions` |

### Advanced (x402 On-Chain)

| User Intent | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| Get x402 payee address | `x402-address --chain ETH --token USDC` — MUST call before Mode B Refill |

## Setup Flow

When the user wants to use Clawallex for the first time:

1. Run `setup --action status` to check current configuration.
2. If **not configured**, ask: "Do you have a Clawallex account?"
   - **Yes**: Ask for API Key and Secret, then run:
     ```
     setup --action connect --api-key KEY --api-secret SECRET
     ```
     This automatically verifies credentials, binds client_id, and saves locally.
   - **No**: Run `setup --action register` to get the sign-up link.
3. Verify with `wallet` to confirm connection works.

## Mode B Flow (x402 On-Chain, Two-Stage)

Mode B is for **callers with self-custody wallets (agent or user)** (DeFi bots, autonomous purchasing agents). The agent signs on-chain transactions using its own signing system — no human intervention needed.

**Stage 1 — Quote:**
```
pay --amount 200 --description "GPU rental" --mode-code 200 --chain-code ETH --token-code USDC
```
The 402 response is **EXPECTED — it is a quote, NOT an error**. Returns:
- `client_request_id`, `payee_address`, `asset_address`, `x402_reference_id`
- `final_card_amount`, `issue_fee_amount`, `fx_fee_amount`, `fee_amount`, `payable_amount`

Fee structure:
- flash card: `fee_amount = issue_fee_amount + fx_fee_amount`
- stream card: `fee_amount = issue_fee_amount + monthly_fee_amount + fx_fee_amount`

**Agent signs** — construct and sign an **EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`** using your own wallet/signing library and the quote details. Only the resulting signature and your wallet address are needed for Stage 2.
EIP-3009 enables gasless USDC transfers via off-chain signatures. The `authorization` fields map to:
- `from`: your wallet address (the payer)
- `to`: `payee_address` from Stage 1 (system receiving address)
- `value`: `maxAmountRequired` (payable_amount in token minimal units, USDC = 6 decimals)
- `validAfter` / `validBefore`: unix timestamps (seconds) defining the signature validity window
- `nonce`: random 32-byte hex, must be unique per authorization

**Stage 2 — Settle (MUST use same client_request_id):**
```
pay --amount 200 --description "GPU rental" \
  --mode-code 200 \
  --client-request-id "uuid-from-stage-1" \
  --x402-version 1 \
  --payment-payload '{
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "ETH",
    "payload": {
      "signature": "0x<agent EIP-3009 signature>",
      "authorization": {
        "from": "0x<agent wallet address>",
        "to": "<payee_address from stage 1>",
        "value": "<maxAmountRequired, e.g. 207590000>",
        "validAfter": "<unix timestamp seconds>",
        "validBefore": "<unix timestamp seconds>",
        "nonce": "0x<random 32-byte hex>"
      }
    }
  }' \
  --payment-requirements '{
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "ETH",
    "asset": "<asset_address from stage 1>",
    "payTo": "<payee_address from stage 1>",
    "maxAmountRequired": "<payable_amount × 10^6, e.g. 207590000>",
    "extra": {
      "referenceId": "<x402_reference_id from stage 1>"
    }
  }' \
  --extra '{"card_amount": "200.0000", "paid_amount": "<payable_amount, e.g. 207.5900>"}'
```

**Stage 2 constraints:**
- `--client-request-id` MUST be identical to Stage 1 — a different value creates a NEW order
- `payment_requirements.payTo` MUST equal `payee_address` from Stage 1
- `payment_requirements.asset` MUST equal `asset_address` from Stage 1
- `payment_requirements.maxAmountRequired` MUST equal `payable_amount` × 10^decimals (USDC = 6 decimals)
- `payment_requirements.extra.referenceId` MUST equal `x402_reference_id` from Stage 1
- `extra.card_amount` MUST equal the `--amount`
- `extra.paid_amount` MUST equal `payable_amount` from Stage 1 (`amount + fee_amount`)
- `payment_payload.network` MUST equal `payment_requirements.network`
- `payload.authorization.to` MUST equal `payment_requirements.payTo`
- `payload.authorization.value` MUST equal `payment_requirements.maxAmountRequired`
- Server will force-inject `extra.mode=STANDARD` — any client-provided value is ignored
- If settle is rejected, order stays `pending_payment` — fix params and retry with same `client_request_id`

## Mode B Refill Flow (no 402 challenge)

Mode B refill goes directly to x402 settle — no 402 challenge stage. Caller signs the EIP-3009 authorization independently using their own wallet/signing library; only the resulting signature and wallet address are submitted. Must call `x402-address` first to get `payee_address`.

```
1. x402-address --chain ETH --token USDC                    → get payee_address
2. refill --card-id c_123 --amount 50 \
     --x402-reference-id "<unique reference id>" \
     --x402-version 1 \
     --payment-payload '{
       "scheme": "exact",
       "network": "ETH",
       "payload": {
         "signature": "0x<EIP-3009 signature>",
         "authorization": {
           "from": "0x<agent wallet>",
           "to": "<payee_address from step 1>",
           "value": "<amount × 10^6>",
           "validAfter": "<unix seconds>",
           "validBefore": "<unix seconds>",
           "nonce": "0x<random 32-byte hex>"
         }
       }
     }' \
     --payment-requirements '{
       "scheme": "exact",
       "network": "ETH",
       "asset": "<asset contract address>",
       "payTo": "<payee_address from step 1>",
       "maxAmountRequired": "<amount × 10^6>",
       "extra": { "referenceId": "<x402_reference_id>" }
     }'
```

Mode B refill idempotency key is `x402_reference_id` (not `client_request_id`).
Check `cards` `mode_code` to determine which refill path the card uses.

## How to Talk to the User

### During setup
- "I need your Clawallex API Key and Secret to get started. You can find them at app.clawallex.com/dashboard/settings."
- If no account: "No problem — I can get you a sign-up link."
- After connect: "You're all set! Want to check your balance?"

### During payments
- Always confirm: "I'll create a $50 card for OpenAI API credits, deducted from your wallet balance. Go ahead?"
- After card creation: "Card created! Let me get the card details for checkout."
- Never show PAN/CVV in conversation. Show only masked_pan if asked.

### On errors
- Don't blame the user. Be actionable: "Your wallet balance is $20 but this needs $50. You can deposit more USDC or try a smaller amount."
- 402 response (Mode B): This is expected — explain it's the first step of a two-stage payment, not an error.

## Decrypting Card Sensitive Data

`card-details` returns `encrypted_sensitive_data` with encrypted PAN/CVV:

1. Derive key: `HKDF-SHA256(ikm=api_secret, salt=empty, info="clawallex/card-sensitive-data/v1", length=32)`
2. Decode: `nonce = base64_decode(nonce)`, `raw = base64_decode(ciphertext)`
3. Split: `encrypted_data = raw[:-16]`, `auth_tag = raw[-16:]`
4. Decrypt: `AES-256-GCM(key, nonce, encrypted_data, auth_tag)` → JSON
5. Result: `{"pan": "4111111111111111", "cvv": "123"}`

## Error Recovery

| Error | Cause | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| "not configured" | No credentials saved | Run `setup --action connect` with valid credentials |
| "Invalid credentials" | Wrong API Key/Secret | Check at app.clawallex.com/dashboard/settings |
| Insufficient balance | Wallet balance too low | Run `recharge-addresses` for deposit info, or use Mode B |
| 402 response | Mode B Stage 1 (expected) | This is the quote — proceed to Stage 2 with same client_request_id |
| Settle rejected (Mode B) | Invalid x402 params | Order stays `pending_payment` — fix params and retry with same client_request_id |
| Card not found | Wrong card_id | Run `cards` to list valid card IDs |
| Decryption failed | Bad data or apiSecret changed | Re-fetch via `card-details`, verify credentials |

## Output Format

All commands return JSON:
- `success: true` → data in `data` field, next steps in `_hint`
- `success: false` → error message in `error` field

## Key Concepts

- **Flash card**: Created by `pay`. Single-use, auto-destroyed after one transaction. Cannot be refilled.
- **Stream card**: Created by `subscribe`. Reloadable, top up with `refill`.
- **Wallet**: Your USDC balance. Funds all Mode A operations.
- **Mode A** (mode_code=100): Wallet balance deduction (default).
- **Mode B** (mode_code=200): x402 on-chain USDC payment for callers with self-custody wallets (agent or user). Two-stage (quote → sign → settle). Agent signs EIP-3009 independently; only the signature and wallet address are passed to Stage 2.
- **client_id**: The agent's stable identity, separate from the API Key. An agent can have multiple API Keys (for rotation/revocation), but `client_id` never changes. Cards and transactions are isolated per `client_id`. When switching to a new API Key, keep using the same `client_id` — the new key auto-binds on first request. Once bound, it cannot be changed (TOFU). Stored locally at `~/.clawallex/credentials.json`.
