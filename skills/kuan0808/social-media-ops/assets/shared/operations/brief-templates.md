## Execution Boundary — Common Examples

| Agent | Common boundaries |
|-------|------------------|
| Engineer | No git push, no deploy, no global installs, no file changes outside scope |
| Designer | Deliver files only, report [BLOCKED] if generation fails |
| Researcher | Report only, use [KB_PROPOSE] for knowledge updates |
| Content | Text delivery only, no publishing |
| Operator | No publishing, no form submission, no deletion without explicit per-step instruction |
| Reviewer | Read-only, no modifications to deliverable |

These are defaults. Each brief may override based on task context (e.g., owner pre-approved a push → brief can say "push allowed after tests pass").
