# ClickUp Skill

Interact with ClickUp's REST API for task management, reporting, and workflow automation.

## Configuration

Before using this skill, ensure the following are configured in `~/.openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md`:

- **API Token:** `CLICKUP_API_KEY`
- **Team/Workspace ID:** `CLICKUP_TEAM_ID`
- **Task Assignee ID:** `CLICKUP_ASSIGNEE_ID`
- **Space IDs** (optional, for filtering)
- **List IDs** (optional, for creating tasks)

Then check if they are available as environment variables:
```bash
echo $CLICKUP_API_KEY
echo $CLICKUP_TEAM_ID
echo $CLICKUP_ASSIGNEE_ID
```

If not available, export them as environment variables.
```bash
export CLICKUP_API_KEY={value}
export CLICKUP_TEAM_ID={value}
export CLICKUP_ASSIGNEE_ID={value}
```


## Quick Start

### Using the Helper Script

The fastest way to query ClickUp:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export CLICKUP_API_KEY="pk_..."
export CLICKUP_TEAM_ID="..."
export CLICKUP_ASSIGNEE_ID="..."

# Get open tasks due or overdue by a given end time
./scripts/clickup-query.sh tasks --end "2026-03-28 17:00"

# Get task counts for open tasks due or overdue by a given end time
./scripts/clickup-query.sh task-count --end "2026-03-28 17:00"

# Get tasks completed during a time window
./scripts/clickup-query.sh completed-tasks --start "2026-03-24" --end "2026-03-28 17:00"

# Get spaces under the team 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh spaces

# Get lists under a space_id
./scripts/clickup-query.sh lists 123456

# Create a task with given title and due date, assign to CLICKUP_ASSIGNEE_ID, under a list_id 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh create-task {list_id} "Follow up with customer" "2026-03-28 17:00"

# Close a task with task_id 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh close-task 86e0jmdfe
```

### Direct API Calls

For custom queries or operations not covered by the helper script. Example:

```bash
# Get all open tasks (with subtasks and pagination)
curl "https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/team/{team_id}/task?include_closed=false&subtasks=true" \
  -H "Authorization: {api_key}"
```

## Common Operations

### Get open tasks due or overdue by a given end time
```bash
# Using helper script 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh tasks --end "2026-03-28 17:00"
```

### Get Task Counts due or overdue by a given end time

```bash
# Using helper script 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh task-count --end "2026-03-28 17:00"

```

### Create a Task with given title and due date
step 1. Get all list 

```bash
# Using helper script 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh spaces
./scripts/clickup-query.sh lists {space_id}

```
Step 2: Choose a list that's most relevant to the task 
Step 3: Create the task 
```bash
# Using helper script 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh create-task {list_id} "Follow up with customer" "2026-03-28 17:00"
```

### Close a Task

```bash
# Using helper script 
./scripts/clickup-query.sh close-task {task_id}
```
