description: Trades Polymarket markets on the top 10 YouTube channels — subscriber milestones, view-count races, channel rivalries — by treating each channel as a distinct volatility asset. Three structural edges: first-hour view velocity mispricing (market prices terminal 24h probability; question asks for first-passage), channel volatility profiles (MrBeast σ=0.25/day vs children's σ=0.02/day), and weekend posting window timing (MrBeast posts 62% of top videos Fri–Sun; edge peaks Thursday entry).

# YouTube Channel Trader

> **This is a remixable template.**
> The default signal requires no external API — it uses hardcoded channel volatility profiles, a first-hour view velocity model, and day-of-week timing applied on top of standard conviction sizing. Wire in YouTube Data API v3 for live subscriber counts and view velocity, and the edge sharpens dramatically.
> The skill handles all the plumbing (market discovery, trade execution, safeguards). Your signal provides the alpha.

## Strategy Overview

The top 10 YouTube channels are treated as distinct financial assets — each with its own volatility profile, growth trajectory, and event calendar. Subscriber counts are market cap. Subscriber deltas are daily returns. View velocity on a new video is trading volume.

Prediction markets on YouTube milestones are systematically mispriced because retail treats all channels the same. They don't. MrBeast has 10× the daily growth volatility of Cocomelon. A milestone 5% above current subscribers has a completely different probability for these two channels.

Three structural edges compound:

**1. First-hour view velocity mispricing**
When a major channel drops a video, view counts do not accumulate uniformly over 24 hours. MrBeast captures ~55% of his 24-hour views in the first hour. A market asking "will this video reach 5M views in the first 2 hours?" is a first-passage probability question. Retail prices it as a terminal probability. The same structural gap that makes BTC weekend markets exploitable makes YouTube flash markets exploitable.

**2. Channel volatility profiles**
Each of the top 10 channels has a measurable daily subscriber growth σ. Children's content (Cocomelon, Kids Diana Show, Like Nastya, Vlad and Niki) has σ ≈ 0.02%/day — extremely stable, like a stablecoin. Milestone markets are fairly priced. MrBeast has σ ≈ 0.25%/day with positive skew (viral videos spike subscribers; nothing crashes them). Milestone markets for MrBeast chronically underprice the upside tail. PewDiePie has high σ with slight negative skew — comeback/retirement uncertainty dominates.

**3. Weekend posting window**
MrBeast has posted 62% of his top-100 most-viewed videos on Friday–Sunday UTC. WWE's major PPV events are almost exclusively on weekends (70%). The timing edge is structurally identical to BTC weekend volatility: enter on Thursday–Friday before the drop, capture the pricing gap before the market reprices on actual view velocity.

## The Ten Assets

| Channel | Subs (M) | Daily σ | Skew | Weekend post % | First-hour % | Content type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MrBeast | 370 | 0.25% | +0.40 | 62% | 55% | viral_challenge |
| T-Series | 275 | 0.04% | +0.10 | 45% | 30% | music |
| Cocomelon | 178 | 0.02% | +0.05 | 40% | 20% | children |
| SET India | 175 | 0.03% | +0.05 | 50% | 25% | tv_content |
| Kids Diana Show | 128 | 0.02% | +0.05 | 38% | 18% | children |
| PewDiePie | 111 | 0.15% | −0.05 | 30% | 45% | commentary |
| Like Nastya | 122 | 0.02% | +0.05 | 42% | 18% | children |
| Vlad and Niki | 120 | 0.02% | +0.05 | 40% | 18% | children |
| Zee Music Company | 108 | 0.04% | +0.10 | 48% | 28% | music |
| WWE | 101 | 0.08% | +0.20 | 70% | 40% | sports_entertainment |

## Signal Logic

### Three multipliers — one per structural edge

**First-hour velocity multiplier** (applied when question contains time-bounded language):

```
velocity_edge = channel.first_hour_pct / 0.30    (normalised to average)
mult = 1.0 + (velocity_edge - 1.0) × 0.40
```

| Channel | first_hour_pct | velocity_mult |
|---|---|---|
| MrBeast | 55% | **1.33x** |
| PewDiePie | 45% | **1.20x** |
| WWE | 40% | **1.13x** |
| T-Series / Zee Music | 28–30% | **1.00x** |
| Children's channels | 18–20% | **0.84x** |

Triggered by: "first hour", "in 2 hours", "in 5 minutes", "in 10 minutes", "within 24 hours", "first day"

**Volatility profile multiplier**:

```
vol_mult   = 1.0 + channel.daily_vol × 2.0
skew_bonus = channel.skew × 0.5
combined   = vol_mult + skew_bonus   (capped 0.80–1.30x)
```

| Channel | daily_vol | skew | vol_mult |
|---|---|---|---|
| MrBeast | 0.25% | +0.40 | **1.30x cap** |
| PewDiePie | 0.15% | −0.05 | **1.28x** |
| WWE | 0.08% | +0.20 | **1.26x** |
| T-Series / Zee | 0.04% | +0.10 | **1.13x** |
| Children's channels | 0.02% | +0.05 | **0.80x** |

**Weekend posting window multiplier**:

```
base_mult = 0.80 + channel.weekend_post × 0.50
timing    = Thursday→1.15x, Friday→1.10x, Saturday→1.00x, Sunday→0.90x, Mon–Wed→0.85x
combined  = base_mult × timing   (capped 0.70–1.35x)
```

| Channel | weekend_post | Thursday base | Thursday combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| WWE | 70% | 1.15x | **1.35x cap** |
| MrBeast | 62% | 1.11x | **1.28x** |
| SET India | 50% | 1.05x | **1.21x** |
| PewDiePie | 30% | 0.95x | **1.09x** |
| Children's | 38–42% | 0.99x | **1.14x** |

### Flash play examples (5-min / 10-min resolution)

**MrBeast video drops Saturday — "Will video reach 5M views in first hour?" at 28%:**

```
velocity_mult = 1.33x  (fhp=55% >> average)
vol_mult      = 1.30x  (σ=0.25%, skew+0.40)
weekend_mult  = 1.00x  (Saturday, mid-window)
combined bias = 1.33 × 1.30 × 1.00 = 1.729 → capped 1.40x

p=28%, YES_THRESHOLD=38%
conviction = (0.38 - 0.28) / 0.38 × 1.40 = 0.37
size = max($5, 0.37 × $30) = $11
```

**WWE WrestleMania weekend — subscriber milestone market — Thursday entry:**

```
velocity_mult = 1.00x  (no time-bounded language)
vol_mult      = 1.26x  (σ=0.08%, skew+0.20)
weekend_mult  = 1.35x  (wp=70%, Thursday→cap)
combined bias = 1.00 × 1.26 × 1.35 = 1.70 → capped 1.40x
```

**Cocomelon subscriber milestone — any day:**

```
velocity_mult = 0.84x  (fhp=18%, slow accumulation)
vol_mult      = 0.80x  (σ=0.02%, very stable)
weekend_mult  = 1.14x  (wp=40%, Thursday)
combined bias = 0.84 × 0.80 × 1.14 = 0.77x
```
Low-vol children's channels trade at reduced conviction — the skill correctly identifies them as "stablecoins" not worth aggressive sizing.

### Sizing table — MrBeast flash play (bias=1.40x, MAX_POSITION=$30)

| Price p | Conviction | Biased | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| 38% (threshold) | 0% | 0% | $5 floor |
| 28% | 26% | 37% | $11 |
| 18% | 53% | 74% | $22 |
| 5% | 87% | 100% | $30 cap |

### Remix signal ideas

- **YouTube Data API v3 (free)**: Wire live subscriber counts and view velocity into `compute_signal` — compare current growth rate to 90-day rolling average; when velocity is 2× average (MrBeast just dropped a video), multiply YES conviction by the velocity ratio; this turns the skill from a timing model into a real-time momentum model
- **First-hour live feed**: During a flash play (5-min/10-min market), poll the YouTube video stats API every 60 seconds and compute the view count accumulation curve; if the first 10 minutes track above the channel's historical P75, back YES on all remaining hour-1 milestones
- **Subscriber rivalry tracker**: The MrBeast vs T-Series subscriber race drove massive Polymarket volume in 2023–24; build a dedicated rivalry module that watches the gap between the #1 and #2 channels and flags markets about rank changes when the gap narrows below 5M
- **PewDiePie return probability**: PewDiePie's irregular posting makes his markets uniquely high-variance; scrape his posting frequency (videos/month) and use a Poisson model to estimate P(posts this week) — wires directly into the weekly/monthly view milestone markets
- **WWE PPV calendar**: Hardcode WWE's annual PPV schedule (WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series) — these are known subscriber spike events; a 2-week window before each PPV should have weekend_post_mult capped at 1.35x regardless of day-of-week

## Safety & Execution Mode

**The skill defaults to paper trading (`venue="sim"`). Real trades only with `--live` flag.**

| Scenario | Mode | Financial risk |
|---|---|---|
| `python trader.py` | Paper (sim) | None |
| Cron / automaton | Paper (sim) | None |
| `python trader.py --live` | Live (polymarket) | Real USDC |

`MIN_DAYS=0` by default — this allows same-day flash plays. Set `SIMMER_MIN_DAYS=1` to restrict to longer-horizon markets only.

`autostart: false` and `cron: null` — nothing runs automatically until you configure it in Simmer UI.

## Required Credentials

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SIMMER_API_KEY` | Yes | Trading authority. Treat as high-value credential. |

## Tunables (Risk Parameters)

| `SIMMER_MAX_SPREAD` | `0.09` | Max bid-ask spread — slightly wider to allow flash markets |
| `SIMMER_MIN_DAYS` | `0` | Min days to resolution — 0 enables same-day flash plays |
| `SIMMER_MAX_POSITIONS` | `10` | Max concurrent open positions |
| `SIMMER_YES_THRESHOLD` | `0.38` | Buy YES if market price ≤ this value |
| `SIMMER_NO_THRESHOLD` | `0.62` | Buy NO if market price ≥ this value |
