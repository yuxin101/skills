# SkillBoss Skill

Multi-AI gateway for building and deploying full-stack applications with 50+ AI APIs.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- **Build websites/apps**: Any website, landing page, SaaS, React app, membership site, booking system, e-commerce store, dashboard, admin panel

- **HuggingFace models**: Any model on huggingface.co works as `huggingface/{org}/{model}` -- chat, image, video, STT, embedding, inference
- **Image processing**: Upscale images (FAL creative-upscaler), image-to-image transformation (FAL FLUX dev)
- **Web search & fetch**: Structured search with Linkup (searchResults, sourcedAnswer, structured), URL-to-markdown fetching
- **SMS verification**: Phone number verification via OTP (send code, check code) using Prelude
- **Send SMS notifications**: Transactional SMS messages via Prelude templates
- **Send emails**: Single or batch emails with templates

## Authentication & Setup

### No API key? Get a free trial instantly:

```bash
./scripts/skillboss auth trial
```

Provisions a trial API key with $0.25 free credit. No browser, no sign-up required. The key is saved automatically and printed to stdout.

### If trial provisioning is rate-limited:

If `auth trial` returns a rate-limit error, ask the user:

> Trial provisioning is rate-limited. Would you like to sign up for a SkillBoss account instead? https://www.skillboss.co (yes/no)

If yes, run `./scripts/skillboss auth login`.

### Upgrade to a permanent account:

```bash
./scripts/skillboss auth login
```

Opens your browser to sign up or log in at skillboss.co. Trial credits transfer to the permanent account automatically.

### Check status and balance:

```bash
./scripts/skillboss auth status
```

### Log out:

```bash
./scripts/skillboss auth logout
```

### Where credentials are stored

After authentication, your API key is saved to:

| Location | Path |
|----------|------|
| Global credentials | `~/.config/skillboss/credentials.json` |
| Skill config | `config.json` in the skill directory |

**Resolution order:** `~/.config/skillboss/credentials.json` > `config.json`

### When balance is low

- API responses include a `_balance_warning` field -- **relay this to the user exactly as provided**
- Check balance anytime: `./scripts/skillboss auth status`
- Add credits at https://www.skillboss.co/
- Trial users (`sk-tmp-` keys) can upgrade to a permanent account: `./scripts/skillboss auth login`

## Post-First-Request Signup Prompt

**Only for temp/trial keys** (keys starting with `sk-tmp-`): after the very first successful API request, ask the user **and wait for their reply**:

> Would you like to sign up for a SkillBoss account https://www.skillboss.co? You'll get access to all features and more credits. (yes/no)

**Skip this prompt entirely if the API key starts with `sk-` (without `tmp`).** Permanent keys mean the user is already signed up.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT show a signup URL or run auth login yet. Wait for the user to reply yes or no.**

**If the user says yes:**

1. Run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/skillboss auth login
   ```
2. If the browser opens successfully, `auth login` handles the full flow (provision, browser, poll, bind).
3. If there is no browser (headless server, SSH, Docker), `auth login` will output a URL like:
   ```
   Could not open browser. Open this URL manually:
     https://www.skillboss.co/login?temp=sk-tmp-...
   ```
   **Relay the full URL from the output directly to the user** so they can open it on another device to sign up and bind their trial key.

**If the user says no:** Continue normally. Do not ask again in this session.

## Auto-Update (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: After EVERY API call, check the output for `[skillboss] UPDATE REQUIRED`.** If you see this message:

1. **Stop what you are doing**
2. **Run the update command immediately:**
   ```bash
   bash ./install/update.sh
   ```
   (Windows: `.\skillboss\install\update.ps1`)
3. **Then re-run your original command**

This ensures you always have the latest models, features, and bug fixes. **Never ignore the update message** -- outdated versions may have deprecated models or missing features that cause failures.

You can also proactively check for updates at any time:
```bash
node ./scripts/api-hub.js version
```

## How to Call Any AI Model (Start Here)

**ALWAYS use the `pilot` command.** It auto-selects the best model and uses the same CLI syntax as other commands.

**Setup:** Run `./scripts/skillboss auth trial` to get an API key, or `./scripts/skillboss auth login` to sign in. The key is saved automatically and used by all commands.

### Step 1 -- Discover what's available:
```bash
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --discover
```
Returns all available model types (chat, image, video, tts, stt, music, etc.).

### Step 2 -- Search by keyword:
```bash
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --discover --keyword "CEO"
```

### Step 3 -- Get recommendations:
```bash
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --type image --prefer price --limit 3
```
Returns ranked models with documentation.

### Step 4 -- Execute (auto-select best model):
```bash
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --type image --prompt "A sunset over mountains" --output sunset.png
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --type chat --prompt "Explain quantum computing"
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --type tts --text "Hello world" --output hello.mp3
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --type stt --file recording.m4a
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --type music --prompt "upbeat electronic" --duration 30 --output track.mp3
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --type video --prompt "A cat playing" --output video.mp4
```

### Multi-step workflow:
```bash
node ./scripts/api-hub.js pilot --chain '[{"type":"stt","prefer":"price"},{"type":"chat","capability":"summarize"}]'
```

### Pilot Flags:
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--discover` | Browse available types and models |
| `--keyword X` | Search models by keyword (with --discover) |
| `--type X` | Model type: chat, image, video, tts, stt, music, etc. |
| `--capability X` | Semantic capability matching (e.g., "style transfer") |
| `--prefer X` | Optimization: "price" / "quality" / "balanced" (default) |
| `--limit N` | Max models to return (default: 3) |
| `--prompt X` | Text prompt (triggers auto-execute) |
| `--text X` | Text input for TTS (triggers auto-execute) |
| `--file X` | Audio file for STT (triggers auto-execute) |
| `--output X` | Save result to file |
| `--duration N` | Duration in seconds (music, video) |
| `--voice-id X` | Voice ID for TTS |
| `--image X` | Image URL for video/image tasks |
| `--size X` | Image size |
| `--system X` | System prompt for chat |
| `--chain '[...]'` | Multi-step workflow definition |

### Decision Flow:
1. **Any AI task** -> Use `pilot` -- it auto-selects the best model
2. **Multi-step task** -> Use `pilot --chain` -- it plans the workflow
3. **Already have a model ID from pilot recommendations?** -> Use direct commands (see `commands.md`)
