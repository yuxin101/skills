# UpKuaJing Company and People Search

Query corporate business information and people data using the UpKuaJing Open Platform API. This skill uses an **entity-driven approach**: finding target entities directly through company attributes (product, industry, size) and people attributes (position, school, experience).

## Overview

This skill provides access to UpKuaJing's global company database and people data through five scripts: two list searches (companies, people) and three enhancement interfaces (company details, people details, contact information).
API key generation and top-up are provided through the `auth.py` script.

## Running Scripts

### Environment Setup

1. **Check Python**: `python --version`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Script directory: `scripts/*.py`
Run example: `python scripts/*.py`

### Two Search Methods

**Company List Search** (`company_list_search.py`)
- **Return granularity**: Each company as one record
- **Use cases**: Focus on "which companies exist"
- **Examples**:
   - "Find manufacturers producing LED lights"
   - "Find tech companies with 100-500 employees"
- **Parameters**: See [Company List](references/company-list-api.md)

**People List Search** (`human_list_search.py`)
- **Return granularity**: Each person as one record
- **Use cases**: Focus on "which people exist"
- **Examples**:
  - "Find CTOs at XXXX"
  - "Find Sales Directors in China for XXX"
- **Parameters**: See [People List](references/human-list-api.md)

### Three Enhancement Interfaces

After obtaining company or people lists, use these interfaces to enrich information when necessary:

**Company Details** (`company_details.py --pids *`)
- Get company business registration information (excluding contact information)
- **Parameters**: `--pids` List of company IDs (space-separated, obtained from list search), max 20 at a time

**People Details** (`human_details.py --hids *`)
- Get detailed person information (education, work experience, etc.)
- **Parameters**: `--hids` List of people IDs (space-separated, obtained from list search), max 20 at a time

**Contact Information** (`get_contact.py --bus_type * --bus_ids *`)
- Get contact information (email, phone, WhatsApp, social media, website)
- **Parameters**:
  - `--bus_type`: 1=company, 2=person
  - `--bus_ids`: List of company IDs or people IDs (space-separated, obtained from list search), max 20 at a time

## API Key and Top-up

This skill requires an API key. The API key is stored in the `~/.upkuajing/.env` file:
```bash
cat ~/.upkuajing/.env
```
**Example file content**:
```
UPKUAJING_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
### **API Key Not Set**
First check if the `~/.upkuajing/.env` file has UPKUAJING_API_KEY;
If UPKUAJING_API_KEY is not set, prompt the user to choose:
1. User has one: User provides it (manually add to ~/.upkuajing/.env file)
2. User doesn't have one: You can apply using the interface (`auth.py --new_key`), the new key will be automatically saved to ~/.upkuajing/.env
Wait for user selection;

### **Account Top-up**
When API response indicates insufficient balance, explain and guide user to top up:
1. Create top-up order (`auth.py --new_rec_order`)
2. Based on order response, send payment page URL to user, guide user to open URL and pay, user confirms after successful payment;

### **Get Account Information**
Use this script to get account information for UPKUAJING_API_KEY: `auth.py --account_info`

## API Key and UpKuaJing Account
- Newly applied API key: Register and login at [UpKuaJing Open Platform](https://developer.upkuajing.com/), then bind account

## Fees

**All API calls incur fees**, different interfaces have different billing methods.
**Latest pricing**: Users can visit [Detailed Price Description](https://www.upkuajing.com/web/openapi/price.html)

### List Search Billing Rules

Billed by **number of calls**, each call returns up to 20 records:
- Number of calls: `ceil(query_count / 20)` times
- **Whenever query_count > 20, must before execution:**
  1. Inform user of expected number of calls
  2. Stop, wait for explicit user confirmation in a separate message, then execute script

### Enhancement Interface Billing Rules

Billed by **number of IDs passed**, max 20 IDs per call:
- Pass 1 ID = billed 1 time
- Pass 20 IDs = billed 20 times (single call limit)
- **Before batch retrieval must:**
  1. Inform user of number of IDs passed and corresponding fee count
  2. Stop, wait for explicit user confirmation in a separate message, then execute script

### Fee Confirmation Principle

**Any operation that incurs fees must first inform and wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not execute in the same message as the notification.**


## Workflow

Choose the appropriate API based on user intent.

### Decision Guide

| User Intent | Use API |
|-------------|---------|
| "Find companies producing XXX" | Company list |
| "Find companies with email/phone" | Company list existEmail=1/existPhone=1 |
| "Find CEO/CTO of XX company" | People list |
| "Find customers purchasing XXX" | Company list |
| "Get person resume" | People details |
| "Get company contact information" | Contact information bus_type=1 |

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Small Query — Search Companies

**User request**: "Find Chinese manufacturers producing LED lights"
```bash
python scripts/company_list_search.py \
  --params '{"products": ["LED lights"], "countryCodes": ["CN"], "existEmail": 1}' \
  --query_count 20
```

### Scenario 2: Search People

**User request**: "Find CTOs at XXXX"
```bash
python scripts/human_list_search.py \
  --params '{"companyNames": ["XXXX"], "titleRoles": ["CTO"]}' \
  --query_count 20
```

### Scenario 3: Large Query — Multiple Script Calls Required

**User request**: "Find 1000 US electronics importers with email addresses"
**Before execution** inform user: ceil(1000/20) = 50 API calls, confirm before executing.
```bash
python scripts/company_list_search.py --params '{"products": ["electronics"], "countryCodes": ["US"], "existEmail": 1}' --query_count 1000
```
**After execution**: Script responds {"task_id":"a1b2-c3d4", "file_url": "xxxxx", ……}
**Continue execution, append data**: Specify task_id, script continues query from last cursor and appends to file
```bash
python scripts/company_list_search.py --task_id 'task-id-here' --query_count 2000
```

## Error Handling

- **API key invalid/non-existent**: Check `UPKUAJING_API_KEY` in `~/.upkuajing/.env` file
- **Insufficient balance**: Guide user to top up
- **Invalid parameters**: **Must first check the corresponding API documentation in references/ directory**, get correct parameter names and formats from documentation, do not guess

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Method

1. **Understand user intent**:
   - Find companies? → Use **company list search**
   - Find people? → Use **people list search**

2. **Check API documentation**:
   - **Before executing list queries, must first check the corresponding API reference documentation**
   - Company list: Check [references/company-list-api.md](references/company-list-api.md)
   - People list: Check [references/human-list-api.md](references/human-list-api.md)
   - Do not guess parameter names, get accurate parameter names and formats from documentation

3. **Optimize query parameters**:
   - Use `products` parameter for precise product filtering, translate to English
   - Use `existEmail=1` or `existPhone=1` to filter entities with contact information
   - Use `countryCodes` to limit country scope

### Handling Results

3. **Handle jsonl files carefully**: For large data queries, pay attention to file size
4. **Gradually enrich information**: Only call details/contact interfaces when needed
   - Company IDs returned by both list interfaces can be used for both detail interfaces
   - If user only needs a few companies, don't get details for all companies

## Notes
- Use hids for people search, pids for company search, be careful to distinguish
- All timestamps are in milliseconds
- Country codes use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format (e.g., CN, US, JP)
- File paths use forward slashes on all platforms
- Product names and industry names must be in **English**
- Search quantity affects API response time, recommend setting timeout:120
- **Prohibit outputting technical parameter format**: Do not display code-style parameters in responses, convert to natural language
- **Do not** estimate or guess per-call fees (each interface has different pricing), if needed use `auth.py --account_info` to get balance
- **Do not** guess parameter names, get accurate parameter names and formats from documentation
