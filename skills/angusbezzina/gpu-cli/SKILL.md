# GPU CLI Skill (Stable)

Use this skill to run the local `gpu` binary from your agent. It only allows invoking the bundled `runner.sh` (which internally calls `gpu`) and read-only file access.

What it does
- Runs `gpu` commands you specify (e.g., `runner.sh gpu status --json`, `runner.sh gpu run python train.py`).
- Recommends a preflight: `gpu doctor --json` then `gpu status --json`.
- Streams results back to chat; use `--json` for structured outputs.

Safety & scope
- Allowed tools: `Bash(runner.sh*)`, `Read`. No network access requested by the skill; `gpu` handles its own networking.
- Avoid chaining or redirection; provide a single `runner.sh gpu …` command.
- You pay your provider directly; this may start paid pods.

Quick prompts
- "Run `runner.sh gpu status --json` and summarize pod state".
- "Run `runner.sh gpu doctor --json` and summarize failures".
- "Run `runner.sh gpu inventory --json --available` and recommend a GPU under $0.50/hr".
- "Run `runner.sh gpu run echo hello` then post the output".

Notes
- For image/video/LLM work, ask the agent to include appropriate flags (e.g., `--gpu-type "RTX 4090"`, `-p 8000:8000`, or `--rebuild`).
