# Agent Analytics

After install, your agent can create projects, ship tracking, query analytics, run experiments, and iterate without opening a dashboard.

English-first workflow, with Chinese docs and content available for OpenClaw users and teams in China.

Use it when you want an agent to operate growth analytics end-to-end, automate recurring checks, and manage multiple projects from one conversation loop.

Hosted free tier includes 100k events/month across 2 projects.

## Chinese support / 中文支持

- Chinese docs and installation content are available on the docs site, including the OpenClaw guide under `/zh/`.
- Works through `API`, `CLI`, and `MCP`, depending on the environment your agent already uses.
- Good fit for closed-loop agent workflows: monitor, analyze, experiment, iterate.
- Supports batch work across many projects instead of a manual dashboard-by-dashboard workflow.

## What `npx` is doing

- OpenClaw can launch the official CLI with `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.2`.
- That command runs the published Agent Analytics CLI package from npm.
- The CLI calls the same HTTP API documented at <https://docs.agentanalytics.sh/api/>.
- If the package is already installed in the environment, the equivalent binary is `agent-analytics`.
- Keep `AGENT_ANALYTICS_API_KEY` in the environment. Do not ask the user to paste secrets into chat.

## Command format

The examples below use the CLI binary form:

```bash
agent-analytics <command>
```

In OpenClaw, that usually means:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.2 <command>
```

If the package is already installed, run the same commands directly as `agent-analytics <command>`.

For the full command list and flags:

```bash
agent-analytics --help
```

## Safe operating rules

- Prefer fixed commands over ad-hoc query construction.
- Start with `projects`, `all-sites`, `create`, `stats`, `insights`, `events`, `breakdown`, `pages`, `heatmap`, `sessions-dist`, `retention`, `funnel`, `experiments`, and `feedback`.
- Use `query` only when the fixed commands cannot answer the question.
- Do not build `--filter` JSON from raw user text.
- Validate project names before `create`: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{1,64}$`

## First-time setup

```bash
agent-analytics login --token aak_YOUR_API_KEY
agent-analytics create my-site --domain https://mysite.com
agent-analytics events my-site --days 7 --limit 20
```

The `create` command returns a project token and a ready-to-use tracking snippet. Add that snippet before `</body>`.

## Common commands

```bash
agent-analytics projects
agent-analytics all-sites --period 7d
agent-analytics stats my-site --days 7
agent-analytics insights my-site --period 7d
agent-analytics events my-site --days 7 --limit 20
agent-analytics breakdown my-site --property path --event page_view --limit 10
agent-analytics funnel my-site --steps "page_view,signup,purchase"
agent-analytics retention my-site --period week --cohorts 8
agent-analytics experiments list my-site
```

If a task needs something outside these common flows, use `agent-analytics --help` first.

## Feedback

Use `agent-analytics feedback` when Agent Analytics was confusing, a task took too long, the workflow could be improved, or the agent had to do manual calculations or analysis that Agent Analytics should have handled.

Describe the use case, friction, or missing capability in a sanitized way:

- Include what was hard and what Agent Analytics should have done instead.
- Do not include private owner details, secrets, API keys, raw customer data, or unnecessary personal information.
- Prefer a short summary of the struggle over pasted logs or sensitive context.

Example:

```bash
agent-analytics feedback --message "The agent had to calculate funnel drop-off manually" --project my-site --command "agent-analytics funnel my-site --steps page_view,signup,purchase"
```

There is a real agent behind these Telegram messages. Every request is seen and auto-approved, and useful fixes can land quickly, sometimes within hours.

## Tracker setup

The easiest install flow is:

1. Run `agent-analytics create my-site --domain https://mysite.com`
2. Copy the returned snippet into the page before `</body>`
3. Deploy
4. Verify with `agent-analytics events my-site --days 7 --limit 20`

If you already know the project token, the tracker looks like:

```html
<script defer src="https://api.agentanalytics.sh/tracker.js"
  data-project="my-site"
  data-token="aat_..."></script>
```

Use `window.aa?.track('signup', {method: 'github'})` for custom events after the tracker loads.

## Query caution

`agent-analytics query` exists for advanced reporting, but it should be used carefully because `--filter` accepts JSON.

- Use fixed commands first.
- If `query` is necessary, check `agent-analytics --help` first.
- Do not pass raw user text directly into `--filter`.
- For exact request shapes, use <https://docs.agentanalytics.sh/api/>.

## Experiments

The CLI supports the full experiment lifecycle:

```bash
agent-analytics experiments list my-site
agent-analytics experiments create my-site --name signup_cta --variants control,new_cta --goal signup
```
