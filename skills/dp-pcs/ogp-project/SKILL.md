# OGP Project Context Management

This skill enables conversational project management with OGP federation. It provides agent-aware project creation with context interviews, freeform logging capabilities, and cross-peer collaboration summaries.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User wants to create a new OGP project with contextual setup
- User expresses intent to log, track, or record information using natural language such as:
  - "add this to project X" / "log that to project Y"
  - "account for this" / "make note of this"
  - "track this" / "remember that"
  - "jot this down" / "save this to [project]"
  - "record this" / "document this"
  - "put this in [project]" / "note for [project]"
  - Any semantic equivalent expressing intent to capture or track information
- User asks about project status, activity, or collaborator contributions
- User wants to understand project context or recent work
- User mentions OGP projects, project logging, or cross-peer collaboration
- Intent recognition should focus on meaning rather than exact keywords

## Core Features

### 1. Project Creation with Context Interview
- Interactive 5-question interview during project creation
- Captures repository, workspace, notes location, collaborators, description
- Stores as structured `context.*` contributions

### 2. Freeform Activity Logging
- Monitors for logging signals ("add this to project X")
- Agent-driven logging of decisions, progress, blockers
- Flexible topic assignment (progress, decision, blocker, context, summary)

### 3. Project-Aware Agent Behavior
- Auto-loads project context on first reference
- Proactive logging during work sessions
- Cross-peer contribution awareness

### 4. Cross-Peer Summarization
- Queries both local and peer contributions
- Unified view of team activity
- Deduplication and synthesis

## Interactive Workflows

### Project Creation Interview

When creating a project, conduct this optional interview:

```bash
# First create the project
ogp project create <project-id> <name> --description "<description>"
```

Then run interview flow:
```
Project created! Let me capture some context (all optional — press Enter to skip):

1. 📁 GitHub/GitLab repo URL?
   → [if provided] ogp project contribute <id> context.repository "<url>"

2. 💻 Local workspace folder?
   → [if provided] ogp project contribute <id> context.workspace "<path>"

3. 📝 Where do you keep notes? (Obsidian vault, Apple Notes, etc.)
   → [if provided] ogp project contribute <id> context.notes "<location>"

4. 👥 Any collaborators already? (peer IDs or names)
   → [if provided] ogp project contribute <id> context.collaborators "<collaborators>"

5. 🎯 One sentence: what is this project about?
   → [if provided] ogp project contribute <id> context.description "<description>"
```

### Freeform Logging Detection

Monitor for natural language expressions indicating logging intent. Focus on intent rather than exact phrasing:

#### Explicit Project Logging Signals
| User Input Pattern | Action | Example |
|-------------------|---------|---------|
| "add this to [project]" | `ogp project contribute <id> context "<summary>"` | Context logging |
| "log that to [project]" | `ogp project contribute <id> progress "<summary>"` | Progress update |
| "save this to [project]" | `ogp project contribute <id> context "<summary>"` | Context logging |
| "put this in [project]" | `ogp project contribute <id> context "<summary>"` | Context logging |
| "record this in [project]" | `ogp project contribute <id> context "<summary>"` | Context logging |
| "document this for [project]" | `ogp project contribute <id> context "<summary>"` | Context logging |
| "note for [project]" | `ogp project contribute <id> context "<summary>"` | Context logging |

#### General Logging Intent (Ask for Project)
| User Input Pattern | Response | Action |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| "account for this" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "make note of this" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "track this" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "remember that" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "jot this down" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "save this" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "record this" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "document this" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |
| "log this" | "Which project should I log this to?" | Prompt for project selection |

#### Contextual Logging Signals
| Situation | Action | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| After coding session | Offer: "Should I log a summary to [project]?" | Proactive logging |
| Decision made | `ogp project contribute <id> decision "<summary>"` | Architecture decisions |
| Blocker encountered | `ogp project contribute <id> blocker "<summary>"` | Issue tracking |

### Project Status and Summarization

**Local project query:**
```bash
# Get project overview
ogp project status <project-id>

# Get recent activity
ogp project query <project-id> --limit 10

# Get specific topics
ogp project query <project-id> --topic progress
ogp project query <project-id> --topic context.repository
```

**Cross-peer collaboration:**
```bash
# Query peer contributions
ogp project query-peer <peer-id> <project-id>

# Get peer project status
ogp project status-peer <peer-id> <project-id>
```

**Synthesized team view:**
1. Query local contributions
2. Query each peer's contributions
3. Merge, deduplicate, and present unified timeline
4. Highlight collaboration patterns and recent activity

## Natural Language Intent Recognition

### Intent Detection Guidelines
The skill should recognize logging intent from varied natural language expressions, not just specific keywords. Focus on semantic meaning:

**Logging Intent Indicators:**
- Words suggesting capture/storage: log, add, save, record, document, track, note, jot, put, remember, account
- Context suggesting information preservation: "for the record", "so we don't forget", "to keep track"
- Imperative tone with information: "make sure we capture this", "don't let this slip"

**Project Identification:**
- Explicit: "add this to [project-name]", "log this in mobile-app"
- Implicit: If no project specified, ask: "Which project should I log this to?" and list active projects
- Smart defaults: If user is currently working in a specific project context, offer that as default

**Intent Confirmation:**
- For explicit project references: Proceed with logging and confirm afterward
- For implicit logging intent: Ask which project and what topic (progress, decision, context, etc.)
- Example: "I'll log that to the mobile-app project as a decision. Sound good?"

**Response Format:**
After successful logging, always confirm:
```
✅ Logged to [project-name] as [topic]
Summary: [brief summary of what was logged]
```

If project selection is needed:
```
📝 I can log this for you. Which project?
Active projects: [project-1], [project-2], [project-3]
Or tell me a new project name to create it.
```

## Agent Instructions

### On Project Reference
When a project is mentioned:
1. **First time**: Fetch all `context.*` contributions to understand the project
2. **Check for updates**: Query recent contributions since last interaction
3. **Cross-peer check**: If project has collaborators, query peer activity

### During Work Sessions
1. **Monitor for decisions**: Log architectural or product decisions automatically
2. **Track blockers**: When user expresses frustration or being stuck, offer to log as blocker
3. **Completion logging**: After significant work, offer: "Should I log a progress summary to [project]?"
4. **Natural language monitoring**: Continuously watch for logging intent expressions:
   - Semantic indicators: words/phrases suggesting information capture or tracking
   - Context clues: tone, imperative statements, information-sharing moments
   - Follow-up questions: when users provide additional details, ask if they want it logged
5. **Intent clarification**: When logging intent is detected but project is unclear:
   - List active projects for selection
   - Offer to create new project if needed
   - Suggest appropriate topic (progress, decision, context, blocker, summary)
6. **Smart defaults**: If user is working in project context, offer that project as default

### Logging Intelligence
**Topic Selection Logic:**
- `progress` — work completed, features implemented, milestones reached
- `decision` — architectural choices, technology selections, product decisions
- `blocker` — things preventing progress, issues encountered, dependencies
- `context` — general observations, meeting notes, requirements changes
- `summary` — periodic digests, weekly summaries, sprint reviews

**Example Logging:**
```bash
# User completed authentication feature
ogp project contribute auth-service progress "Implemented OAuth2 login flow with GitHub provider. Added JWT token management and user session persistence. All tests passing."

# User made architectural decision
ogp project contribute auth-service decision "Decided to use Redis for session storage instead of database. Better performance for frequent session lookups and automatic expiration."

# User encountered blocker
ogp project contribute auth-service blocker "GitHub OAuth app approval pending. Cannot test production flow until approved. Estimated 2-3 days delay."
```

## CLI Command Reference

## Integration Examples

### After Code Implementation
```
User: "I just finished the authentication system"

Agent: "Great! Should I log this progress to the auth-service project?"
[User confirms]

Agent runs: ogp project contribute auth-service progress "Completed authentication system implementation. Added OAuth2 with GitHub, JWT token management, user sessions, password reset flow. All unit tests passing, ready for integration testing."
```

### During Architecture Decision
```
User: "I think we should use PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB for this"

Agent: "That sounds like an important architectural decision. Should I document this in the project?"
[User confirms]

Agent runs: ogp project contribute inventory-system decision "Switched from MongoDB to PostgreSQL for data persistence. Reasons: better ACID guarantees for inventory tracking, existing team expertise, superior query performance for reporting needs."
```

### Cross-Peer Status Check
```
User: "What has Alice been working on in the mobile-app project?"

Agent runs:
1. ogp project query-peer alice:18790 mobile-app --limit 10
2. ogp project query mobile-app --limit 10 --author alice

Agent: "Alice's recent contributions to mobile-app:
• 2 days ago: Implemented push notification system
• 4 days ago: Fixed authentication token refresh bug
• 1 week ago: Added offline data sync capability

Total: 8 contributions this month, very active on backend integration work."
```

### Natural Language Intent Recognition Examples

#### Explicit Project Logging
```
User: "Account for this API rate limiting issue in the mobile-app project"

Agent: "I'll log that rate limiting issue to the mobile-app project as a blocker."
Agent runs: ogp project contribute mobile-app blocker "API rate limiting issue encountered affecting user authentication flow"

Agent: "✅ Logged to mobile-app as blocker
Summary: API rate limiting issue affecting authentication"
```

#### Implicit Project Selection
```
User: "Make note of this - we decided to use React Native instead of Flutter"

Agent: "📝 I can log this architectural decision for you. Which project?
Active projects: mobile-app, web-portal, backend-api
Or tell me a new project name to create it."

User: "mobile-app"

Agent runs: ogp project contribute mobile-app decision "Decided to use React Native instead of Flutter for mobile development"

Agent: "✅ Logged to mobile-app as decision
Summary: React Native chosen over Flutter for mobile development"
```

#### Context-Aware Logging
```
User: "Track this - the database migration will need to happen during off-peak hours"

Agent: "Which project should I log this to?"
Active projects: backend-api, data-pipeline

User: "backend-api"

Agent: "I'll log that deployment constraint to backend-api. Sound good?"
Agent runs: ogp project contribute backend-api context "Database migration must be scheduled during off-peak hours for minimal service disruption"

Agent: "✅ Logged to backend-api as context
Summary: Database migration timing constraint noted"
```

#### Smart Default Suggestion
```
[User is currently working on authentication feature in auth-service project]

User: "Remember that we need to handle the OAuth token refresh edge case"

Agent: "I'll log that OAuth consideration to the auth-service project as context. Sound good?"

User: "Yes"

Agent runs: ogp project contribute auth-service context "Need to handle OAuth token refresh edge case for seamless user experience"

Agent: "✅ Logged to auth-service as context
Summary: OAuth token refresh edge case handling requirement"
```

#### Multi-Language/Phrasing Support
```
User: "Jot this down - the API endpoint needs rate limiting"

Agent: "Which project should I log this to?"
Active projects: backend-api, mobile-app

User: "backend-api"

Agent runs: ogp project contribute backend-api context "API endpoint requires rate limiting implementation for security and performance"

Agent: "✅ Logged to backend-api as context
Summary: Rate limiting requirement for API endpoint"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Project Not Found
```bash
# List available projects
ogp project list

# Check if peer project exists
ogp project status-peer <peer-id> <project-id>
```

### Logging Failures
```bash
# Verify project exists and you're a member
ogp project status <project-id>

# Check OGP daemon status
ogp status
```

### Cross-Peer Issues
```bash
# Verify peer is approved and has project scope
ogp federation list --status approved
ogp federation scopes <peer-id>

# Test basic peer connectivity
ogp federation send <peer-id> message '{"text":"ping"}'
```

### No Context Loaded
If agent seems unaware of project context:
1. Check `context.*` contributions exist: `ogp project query <id> --topic context`
2. Verify project membership: `ogp project status <id>`
3. Restart skill to reload project data

## Implementation Notes

**Data Flow:**
```
User Input → Agent Skill → OGP CLI → OGP Daemon → ~/.ogp/projects.json
                                  ↓
                            Federation (if peer project)
                                  ↓
                            Peer's OGP Daemon → OpenClaw Agent
```

**Skill Behavior:**
- Always load `context.*` on first project reference
- Proactively offer logging after significant work
- Monitor conversation for logging signals
- Cross-reference peer activity for collaboration awareness
- Synthesize unified views across local + peer contributions

**Storage:**
- Projects stored in `~/.ogp/projects.json`
- Contributions organized by topic within each project
- Cross-peer queries via federation protocol
- Activity logged locally for retrospectives

This skill bridges the gap between OGP's technical capabilities and natural conversational project management, enabling seamless collaboration across federated AI agents.
