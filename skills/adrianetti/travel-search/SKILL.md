# Travel Search

Search flights, hotels, car rentals, and ferries across multiple free providers via MCP protocol.

## Quick Reference

| Need | Provider | Reference |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Flights (creative routing) | Kiwi.com | [flights.md](references/flights.md) |
| Flights + Hotels + Cars | Skiplagged | [skiplagged.md](references/skiplagged.md) |
| Hotels (price comparison) | Trivago | [hotels.md](references/hotels.md) |
| Ferries | Ferryhopper | [ferries.md](references/ferries.md) |
| Flights (Google Flights) | fli | [google-flights.md](references/google-flights.md) |
| Full trip itinerary | Multi-provider | [trip-planner.md](references/trip-planner.md) |
| Best deal / price compare | Multi-provider | [price-tools.md](references/price-tools.md) |

## How It Works

All providers use the MCP protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP). Call them with `curl`:

```bash
# 1. Initialize session
curl -s -X POST "$MCP_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"openclaw","version":"1.0"}}}'

# 2. Extract Mcp-Session-Id from response headers (if returned)

# 3. Call a tool
curl -s -X POST "$MCP_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"TOOL_NAME","arguments":{...}}}'
```

Response format: SSE with `event: message` + `data: {JSON}`. Parse the `data` line.

## Decision Guide

### User wants flights, hotels, cars, ferries, or trip planning
Read [price-tools.md](references/price-tools.md) for the **decision tree and comparison engine**. It covers:
- Which providers to search and when
- How to compare and score results across providers
- How to present the single best recommendation + alternatives
- Flexible dates, anywhere destinations, round-trip optimization

For full trip itineraries, also read [trip-planner.md](references/trip-planner.md). It includes a **guided intake questionnaire** (7 quick questions in one message) for when users want help figuring out what they want.

### Core principle
**Always search multiple providers, score results, and present ONE best recommendation** with alternatives. The user should never have to compare — that's the agent's job. See [price-tools.md](references/price-tools.md) for the value scoring system.

## Presenting Results

Use bullet lists (no markdown tables on Discord/WhatsApp). For each option show:
- Route with stops (e.g., OVD → BCN → FCO)
- Times and duration
- Price
- Booking link

Group by: 💸 Cheapest → ⚡ Fastest → 🎯 Best value

Always include booking deep links so the user can act immediately.

## Notes
- All Tier 1 providers are free, no API key needed
- Kiwi uses `dd/mm/yyyy` date format
- Skiplagged uses `YYYY-MM-DD` date format
- Always resolve city names to IATA codes first when using Skiplagged
- Rate limit: be reasonable, don't spam requests
- MCP sessions may expire; re-initialize if you get errors
