## Install

```bash
openclaw skills install travel-search
```

Or clone directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrianetti/travel-search.git
cp -r travel-search ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
```

## Providers

| Provider | Type | Coverage | API Key |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com) | Flights | Worldwide, creative routing | 🆓 Free |
| [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com) | Flights + Hotels + Cars | Worldwide, hidden city fares | 🆓 Free |
| [Trivago](https://trivago.com) | Hotels | Worldwide, price comparison | 🆓 Free |
| [Ferryhopper](https://ferryhopper.com) | Ferries | 33 countries, 190+ operators | 🆓 Free |
| [Google Flights](https://github.com/punitarani/fli) | Flights | Widest coverage | 🆓 Free (requires `pipx install flights`) |

All providers use the [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP) — no browser automation, no scraping.

## Usage Examples

Once installed, just ask your agent naturally:

- *"Find me cheap flights from Madrid to Tokyo in April"*
- *"Compare hotels in Rome for April 10-14"*
- *"What's the cheapest way to get from Oviedo to Rome?"*
- *"Find car rentals in Barcelona for next week"*
- *"Search ferries from Piraeus to Santorini in July"*
- *"Where can I fly cheap from Madrid?"* (uses Skiplagged's "anywhere" search)
- *"When is it cheapest to fly to London?"* (flexible date calendar)
- *"Plan me a 5-day trip to Rome with a budget of €800"* (full itinerary with prices)
- *"Build an itinerary for 2 weeks in Japan"* (day-by-day plan + flights + hotels)

## How It Works

The skill teaches AI agents to call travel provider MCP servers directly via `curl`. Each provider returns structured JSON with prices, routes, times, and booking links. The agent then formats and presents the best options.

```
User: "Find flights from Barcelona to Rome"
  → Agent loads references/flights.md
  → Calls Kiwi.com MCP API
  → Gets JSON with 15 flights, prices, deep links
  → Presents top 3-5 options grouped by cheapest/fastest/best value
```
