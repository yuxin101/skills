| **What it is** | An evaluation-driven skill evolution engine for Claude Code / OpenClaw — six-dimension scoring, directed improvement, version management. |
| **Pain it solves** | Turns "tweak and hope" into diagnose → targeted fix → verified improvement. |
| **Use in 30 seconds** | `/skill-compass evaluate {skill}` — instant quality report showing exactly what's weakest and what to improve next. |

> **Find the weakest link → fix it → prove it worked → next weakness → repeat.**

---

## Who This Is For

<table>
<tr><td width="50%">

**For**
- Anyone maintaining agent skills and wanting measurable quality
- Developers who want directed improvement — not guesswork, but knowing exactly which dimension to fix next
- Teams needing a quality gate — any tool that edits a skill gets auto-evaluated

</td><td>

**Not For**
- General code review or runtime debugging
- Creating new skills from scratch (use skill-creator)
- Evaluating non-skill files

</td></tr>
</table>

---

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Claude Opus 4.6 (complex reasoning + consistent scoring) &middot; Node.js v18+ (local validators)

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evol-ai/SkillCompass.git
cd SkillCompass && npm install

# User-level (all projects)
rsync -a --exclude='.git'  . ~/.claude/skills/skill-compass/

# Or project-level (current project only)
rsync -a --exclude='.git'  . .claude/skills/skill-compass/
```

> **First run:** Claude Code will request permission for `node -e` and `bash` commands. Select **"Allow always"** to avoid repeated prompts.

### OpenClaw

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evol-ai/SkillCompass.git
cd SkillCompass && npm install
# Follow OpenClaw skill installation docs for your setup
rsync -a --exclude='.git'  . <your-openclaw-skills-path>/skill-compass/
```

---

## Usage

Two ways to invoke SkillCompass:

### `/skill-compass` + natural language

```
/skill-compass evaluate ./my-skill/SKILL.md
/skill-compass improve the nano-banana skill
/skill-compass security scan ./my-skill/SKILL.md
/skill-compass audit all skills in .claude/skills/
/skill-compass compare my-skill 1.0.0 vs 1.0.0-evo.2
/skill-compass roll back my-skill to previous version
```

### Or just talk to Claude

No slash command needed — Claude automatically recognizes the intent:

```
Evaluate the nano-banana skill for me
Improve this skill — fix the weakest dimension
Scan all skills in .claude/skills/ for security issues
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Capability reference</strong></summary>

| Intent | Maps to |
|--------|---------|
| Evaluate / score / review a skill | `eval-skill` |
| Improve / fix / upgrade a skill | `eval-improve` |
| Security scan a skill | `eval-security` |
| Batch audit a directory | `eval-audit` |
| Compare two versions | `eval-compare` |
| Merge with upstream | `eval-merge` |
| Rollback to previous version | `eval-rollback` |

</details>

## What It Does

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/skill-quality-report.png" alt="SkillCompass — Skill Quality Report" width="520" />
</p>

The score isn't the point — **the direction is.** You instantly see which dimension is the bottleneck and what to do about it.

Each `/eval-improve` round follows a closed loop: **fix the weakest → re-evaluate → verify improvement → next weakest**. No fix is saved unless the re-evaluation confirms it actually helped.

## Six-Dimension Evaluation Model

| ID | Dimension | Weight | What it evaluates |
|:--:|-----------|:------:|-------------------|
| **D1** | Structure | 10% | Frontmatter validity, markdown format, declarations |
| **D2** | Trigger | 15% | Activation quality, rejection accuracy, discoverability |
| **D3** | Security | 20% | Secrets, injection, permissions, exfiltration |
| **D4** | Functional | 30% | Core quality, edge cases, output stability, error handling |
| **D5** | Comparative | 15% | Value over direct prompting (with vs without skill) |
| **D6** | Uniqueness | 10% | Overlap with similar skills, model supersession risk |

```
overall_score = round((D1×0.10 + D2×0.15 + D3×0.20 + D4×0.30 + D5×0.15 + D6×0.10) × 10)
```

| Verdict | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| **PASS** | score ≥ 70 AND D3 pass |
| **CAUTION** | 50–69, or D3 High findings |
| **FAIL** | score < 50, or D3 Critical (gate override) |

## Features

### Core Loop

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Directed Evolution** | Diagnose → targeted fix → verify → next weakness. Not random patching. |
| **Closed-Loop Improve** | `/eval-improve` auto re-evaluates after each fix. Only saves if improved and nothing regressed. |
| **Scope Control** | `--scope gate` = D1+D3 (~8K tokens). `--scope target --dimension D4` = single dim + gate. |
| **Tiered Verification** | L0 syntax → L1 single dimension → L2 full re-eval → L3 cross-skill. |
| **D1+D2 Grouping** | Both metadata dimensions weak (≤5)? Improved together — they share the frontmatter layer. |

### Safety

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pre-Accept Gate** | Hooks auto-scan every SKILL.md write. D1 + D3 checks. Zero config. Warns, never blocks. |
| **Pre-Eval Scan** | Static analysis blocks malicious code, exfiltration, prompt injection before LLM eval. |
| **Output Guard** | Validates improvement output for URL injection, dangerous commands, size anomalies. |
| **Auto-Rollback** | Any dimension drops >2 points after improvement? Changes discarded. |
| **Local Validators** | JS-based D1/D2/D3 validators run locally. Saves ~60% tokens on clear-cut issues. |

### Smart Optimization

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Correction Tracking** | Detects repeated manual fixes, maps to dimensions, prompts update at next invocation. |
| **Feedback Integration** | Real usage data fuses into scores: 60% static + 40% feedback signals. |
| **Multi-Language Triggers** | Detects your language, tests trigger accuracy in it, fixes multilingual gaps. |
| **Obsolescence Detection** | Compares skill vs base model. Tracks supersession risk across model updates. |
| **Skill Type Detection** | Auto-classifies atom / composite / meta. Evaluation adapts accordingly. |

### Version & Scale

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Version Management** | SHA-256 hashed snapshots. Rollback to any version anytime. |
| **Three-Way Merge** | Merges upstream updates region-by-region. Local improvements preserved. |
| **Multi-Round Evolution** | `/eval-evolve` runs up to 6 rounds autonomously. Stops at PASS or plateau. |
| **Batch Audit + Auto-Fix** | `/eval-audit --fix --budget 3` scans worst-first, auto-fixes within budget. |
| **CI Mode** | `--ci` flag, exit codes: 0=PASS, 1=CAUTION, 2=FAIL. |

## Works With Everything

No point-to-point integration needed. The Pre-Accept Gate intercepts all SKILL.md edits regardless of source.

| Tool | How it works together | Guide |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| **Auto-Updater** | Pulls new version → Gate auto-checks for security regressions → keep or rollback | [guide](examples/guide-auto-updater.md) |
| **Claudeception** | Extracts skill → auto-evaluation catches security holes + redundancy → directed fix | [guide](examples/guide-claudeception.md) |
| **Self-Improving Agent** | Logs errors → feed as signals → SkillCompass maps to dimensions and fixes | [guide](examples/guide-self-improving-agent.md) |

---

## Feedback Signal Standard

SkillCompass defines an open `feedback-signal.json` schema for any tool to report skill usage data:

```bash
/eval-skill ./my-skill/SKILL.md --feedback ./feedback-signals.json
```

Signals: `trigger_accuracy`, `correction_count`, `correction_patterns`, `adoption_rate`, `ignore_rate`, `usage_frequency`. The schema is extensible (`additionalProperties: true`) — any pipeline can produce or consume this format.
