# /eval-improve — Evaluate + Directed Improvement

## Prerequisites

- **Recommended model: Claude Opus 4.6** (`claude-opus-4-6`). Directed improvement requires understanding complex rubric feedback and generating precise, targeted edits. Weaker models may produce unfocused rewrites that fail to address the weakest dimension or introduce regressions in other dimensions.

## Arguments

- `<path>` (required): Path to the SKILL.md file to improve.
- `--dimension D{N}` (optional): Override which dimension to target. If omitted, targets the weakest.
- `--feedback <path>` (optional): Passed through to eval-skill.

## Phase 1: Evaluate

Execute the full `/eval-skill` evaluation flow on the target skill. Use the **Read** tool to load `{baseDir}/commands/eval-skill.md` and follow its steps 1-18 with `--scope full`. Capture the complete JSON evaluation result.

**Do NOT duplicate eval-skill logic here.** Delegate entirely.

## Phase 2: Snapshot

Use the **Read** tool to load `{baseDir}/shared/version-management.md`. Follow the snapshot procedure:

1. Read or create the manifest for this skill.
2. Compute the content hash of the current SKILL.md.
3. Save a snapshot copy to `.skill-compass/{skill-name}/snapshots/{current-version}.md` using the **Write** tool.
4. Create a transient self-write lock: use the **Write** tool to create `.skill-compass/.write-lock` with content `{ "until": {unix_timestamp_now + 5} }`. This prevents SkillCompass's own PostToolUse hooks from re-triggering during the confirmed improvement write.

## Phase 3: Diagnose

From the evaluation result:
1. If verdict is FAIL due to security gate: **always target D3 first**, regardless of `--dimension` flag. Security issues must be resolved before other improvements.
2. If `--dimension` was specified: use that dimension as the target.
3. Otherwise: use the `weakest_dimension` field from the eval result.

### Metadata-Layer Grouping (D1 + D2)

If the target dimension is D1 or D2, and the OTHER metadata dimension (D2 or D1 respectively) also scores ≤ 5, group them into a single improvement round:
- Target becomes `["D1", "D2"]` (both)
- Display: "Dimensions D1 ({score}) and D2 ({score}) are both weak and share the metadata layer. Improving both in a single round."

This grouping ONLY applies to D1+D2 (both affect frontmatter/description). Do NOT group other dimension combinations — they modify different parts of the skill and could interfere.

Display diagnosis: which dimension(s), current score(s), specific issues from the evaluation.

## Phase 4: Improve

Use the **Read** tool to load `{baseDir}/prompts/improve.md`. Pass:
- `{SKILL_CONTENT}`: current SKILL.md content
- `{EVAL_REPORT}`: full JSON evaluation result
- `{TARGET_DIMENSION}`: the dimension(s) to improve (single key or array for D1+D2 group)

Generate the improved version. Show the diff to the user. **Ask for confirmation before writing.**

If the user declines: stop. Report "Improvement declined by user." and exit.

Before writing the improved SKILL.md, refresh the self-write lock: update `.skill-compass/.write-lock` with `{ "until": {unix_timestamp_now + 5} }`.

## Phase 5: Targeted Verification

After the user confirms and the improved SKILL.md is written:

**Do NOT re-run full 6-dimension evaluation.** Instead, run a targeted re-eval:

1. **Always re-evaluate these dimensions:**
   - The target dimension(s) — to confirm improvement
   - D3 (Security gate) — to ensure no security regression
   - D4 (Functional, 30% weight) — to catch unintended instruction damage
2. **For non-evaluated dimensions:** use cached scores from Phase 1.
3. **Recalculate overall_score** using the formula: re-evaluated scores for target+D3+D4, cached scores for the rest.

To run the targeted re-eval, follow the eval-skill Steps 1-4 (load target, types, config, scoring), then only the Steps for the dimensions listed above. Use `{baseDir}/prompts/d{N}-*.md` for each.

Check verification criteria:
- **Target dimension improved?** (score increased by ≥ 1 point)
- **No major regression?** (D3 and D4 did not drop by > 2 points)
- **Security gate still passes?** (if it passed before, it must still pass)

Mark the verification in output: `"verification": "targeted", "re_evaluated": ["D2", "D3", "D4"]`.

## Phase 6: Save or Rollback

### If verification passes:

1. Save as new evo version. Follow version-management.md rules:
   - Increment `-evo.N` suffix
   - Update manifest with new version entry:
     - `trigger`: `"eval-improve"`
     - `target_dimension`: the dimension(s) targeted
     - `overall_score` and `verdict`: from targeted verification result
     - `dimension_scores`: merge re-evaluated dimension scores with cached scores from Phase 1 into a single `{"D1":n,...,"D6":n}` object
     - `correction_pattern`: one plain-language sentence combining the problem and fix (e.g., "Description was too vague to discover; rewrote with specific keywords and scope boundaries")
   - Save new snapshot
2. Clean up: delete `.skill-compass/.write-lock` if it exists.
3. Display the **Improvement Summary** (mandatory, always show):

```
## Improvement Summary: {skill-name}

{version_before} → {version_after}  |  Overall: {score_before} → {score_after} ({verdict_before} → {verdict_after})

### What was wrong
{target_dimension} scored {score_before_dim}/10:
- {issue_1 from eval report, in plain language}
- {issue_2 ...}

### What was fixed
- {changelog.changes[0].what}: {changelog.changes[0].why}
- {changelog.changes[1].what}: {changelog.changes[1].why}
- ...

### Impact
- {target_dimension}: {score_before_dim} → {score_after_dim} ({delta with + sign})
- {any other dimension that changed}: {before} → {after}
- Verdict: {verdict_before} → {verdict_after}
{if verdict changed to PASS: "✓ This skill now passes quality standards."}
{if verdict still not PASS: "Next step: run /eval-improve again to target {new_weakest_dimension} ({its_score}/10)."}
```

**Rules for this summary:**
- Use the evaluation `details` and `issues` fields to explain problems in plain language, not dimension codes.
- Translate technical findings into user-understandable impact (e.g., "hardcoded database password" not "D3 Critical finding in category secret").
- Keep each bullet to one sentence.
- If D1+D2 were grouped, show both dimensions in the summary.

### If verification fails:

1. Restore the original SKILL.md from the snapshot taken in Phase 2.
2. Explain what went wrong:
   - "Target dimension did not improve" or
   - "Regression detected: {dimension} dropped from {old} to {new}" or
   - "Security gate failed after improvement"
3. Suggest alternatives: try a different approach, target a different dimension, or manual edit.
4. Clean up: delete `.skill-compass/.write-lock` if it exists.
