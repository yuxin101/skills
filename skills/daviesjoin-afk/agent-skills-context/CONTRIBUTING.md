# Contributing to Agent Skills for Context Engineering

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collection of Agent Skills for Context Engineering. This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find errors, unclear explanations, or missing topics, please open an issue with:
- A clear description of the problem
- The skill and section where the issue was found
- Suggested improvements if you have them

### Submitting Changes

For substantive changes, please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch for your changes
3. Make changes following the skill template structure
4. Ensure SKILL.md files remain under 500 lines
5. Add references or scripts as appropriate
6. Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes

### Adding New Skills

When adding new skills:

1. Use the template in `template/SKILL.md`
2. Follow naming conventions (lowercase with hyphens)
3. Include both SKILL.md and appropriate references/scripts
4. Update the root README.md to include the new skill
5. Ensure content is platform-agnostic (works across Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)

## Skill Structure Requirements

Each skill must include:

- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Clear sections with logical organization
- Practical examples where appropriate
- Integration notes linking to related skills

Optional additions:

- `references/` directory with additional documentation
- `scripts/` directory with executable examples
- Multiple markdown files for complex skills

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Be direct and precise
- Use technical terminology appropriately
- Include specific guidance, not vague recommendations
- Provide concrete examples
- Point out complexity and trade-offs

### Avoiding Platform Specificity

Skills should work across agent platforms. Avoid:
- Platform-specific tool names without abstraction
- Vendor-locked examples
- Features specific to one agent product

### Keeping Skills Focused

Each skill should have a single focus. If a topic grows too large, consider splitting into multiple skills with clear dependencies.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a professional, technical collaboration model. Be respectful of different perspectives and focus on improving the collective knowledge base.

## Questions
