# Docs Cog - Professional Documents Powered by CellCog

**Deep reasoning. Accurate data. Beautiful design.** The three things every great document needs — and most AI gets wrong.

CellCog gets them right: **#1 on DeepResearch Bench (Feb 2026)** for deep reasoning, **SOTA search models** for factually grounded content, and **state-of-the-art document generation** — PDF or native DOCX, both rivaling professional design studios. Resumes, contracts, reports, proposals — delivered in minutes, looking like they took days.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `cellcog` skill for SDK setup and API calls.

```bash
clawhub install cellcog
```

**Read the cellcog skill first** for SDK setup. This skill shows you what's possible.

**Quick pattern (v1.0+):**
```python
# Fire-and-forget - returns immediately
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your document request]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="document-task",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode for most documents
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## Output Formats

CellCog generates professional documents in multiple formats:

### PDF (Default for Ambiguous Requests)

When you say "create a report" or "make a document" without specifying a format, CellCog generates PDF — perfect typography, layouts, and design with full creative control.

### DOCX (First-Class Support)

When you explicitly request DOCX ("create a Word document", "make a .docx"), CellCog generates native Word directly — editable, compatible with Microsoft Word and Google Docs, great for collaborative workflows where multiple people contribute.

**Just ask for DOCX and you'll get it.** No need to justify why you want an editable format.

## Chat Mode for Documents

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Standard documents - resumes, invoices, reports, certificates | `"agent"` |
| Complex documents requiring narrative craft - proposals, white papers, case studies | `"agent team"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most documents.** Resumes, contracts, reports, and standard business documents execute well in agent mode.

**Use `"agent team"` for high-stakes documents** where persuasion and narrative flow matter—investor proposals, detailed white papers, compelling case studies.

## Tips for Better Documents

1. **Provide the content**: Don't say "write about my experience" - provide actual details, numbers, and facts.

2. **Specify structure**: "Include: Executive summary, problem, solution, timeline, pricing" gives clear direction.

3. **Design preferences**: "Modern and minimal", "Corporate professional", "Bold and colorful" - describe what you want.

4. **Brand elements**: Mention colors, logos (upload them), or reference existing brand guidelines.

5. **Audience context**: "For investors", "For enterprise clients", "For students" changes tone and detail level.

6. **Choose your format**: PDF is the default for polished output. Request DOCX when your team needs to edit or customize the document.
