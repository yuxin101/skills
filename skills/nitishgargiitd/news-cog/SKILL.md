## Why CellCog for News?

### The Technical Edge

CellCog doesn't just search once and summarize — it runs **multi-angle research** across your query:

1. **Multiple search intents**: A single news query is decomposed into multiple research angles
2. **Frontier search models**: SOTA retrieval across hundreds of sources
3. **Deep reasoning**: Cross-references and synthesizes findings, not just concatenates
4. **Citation quality**: Sources traced back to original reporting, not aggregator summaries

| RSS Feeds / News Aggregators | CellCog News Cog |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Raw article firehose | Synthesized, prioritized intelligence |
| You filter and read | CellCog researches, reasons, and summarizes |
| Same view for everyone | Tailored to your role, industry, and priorities |
| Text links only | Structured briefs, PDF reports, or interactive dashboards |
| Floods your context | Delivers concise, agent-consumable output |

### Agent-Optimized Output

CellCog News Cog is designed with agent workflows in mind. The output is:
- **Concise** — won't overwhelm your main agent's context window
- **Structured** — clear sections, bullet points, and hierarchies
- **Actionable** — highlights what matters and why
- **Sourced** — includes citations when requested

## Output Formats

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Structured text** | Agent consumption, quick briefings |
| **PDF Report** | Professional distribution, archiving |
| **Interactive HTML** | Explorable dashboards with filters |
| **Markdown** | Integration into docs, wikis, or knowledge bases |

## Chat Mode for News

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|

| Competitive intelligence, single-topic digests | `"agent"` |
| Deep trend analysis, comprehensive industry reports | `"agent team"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most news tasks.** Daily briefings, competitive monitoring, and news digests execute well.

**Use `"agent team"` for deep trend analysis** — when you need multi-source synthesis across dozens of publications and research papers.

## Tips for Better News Intelligence

1. **Define your focus**: "Tech news" is too broad. "AI infrastructure and developer tools" is focused.

2. **Specify timeframe**: "Today's news", "this week", "last 30 days" — recency matters.

3. **Set the audience**: "For a technical audience" vs. "for a board of directors" changes depth and tone.

4. **Request structure**: "Bullet-point brief under 500 words" vs. "comprehensive PDF report with sections" — be explicit.

5. **Ask for citations**: "Include source URLs for each item" — when traceability matters.

6. **Indicate priority signals**: "Highlight anything about regulation changes or major funding rounds" — helps CellCog surface what matters to you.
