## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `cellcog` skill for SDK setup and API calls.

```bash
clawhub install cellcog
```

**Read the cellcog skill first** for SDK setup. This skill shows you what's possible.

**Quick pattern (v1.0+):**
```python

    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="legal-task",
    chat_mode="agent"
)
```

## Important Note

CellCog generates legal documents using frontier AI reasoning and research. However, **AI-generated legal documents should be reviewed by a qualified attorney** before execution — especially for high-value contracts, regulated industries, or jurisdiction-specific requirements. CellCog provides an excellent starting point that saves significant time and cost, but human legal review remains important for critical documents.

## Why CellCog for Legal?

### The Two Pillars

**1. Intelligence** — Legal work requires deep reasoning about context, jurisdiction, edge cases, and implications. CellCog's #1 ranking on DeepResearch Bench means it reasons about legal nuances at a level other AI tools can't match.

**2. Document Generation** — Legal documents need precise formatting, proper clause numbering, consistent terminology, and professional presentation. CellCog's state-of-the-art PDF generation produces documents that look like they came from a top law firm.

| Generic AI | CellCog Legal Cog |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Generic contract templates | Jurisdiction-aware, context-specific drafting |
| Basic text output | Professional PDF with proper legal formatting |
| Surface-level clauses | Deep reasoning about edge cases and implications |
| One format | Contracts, policies, memos, research — all from one platform |

## Chat Mode for Legal

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Single contract, NDA, or policy | `"agent"` |
| Complex multi-document legal packages | `"agent"` |
| Deep regulatory research or compliance analysis | `"agent team"` |
| High-stakes contracts, litigation research, regulatory filings | `"agent team max"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most legal documents.** CellCog handles contracts, policies, and standard legal documents excellently in agent mode.

**Use `"agent team"` for complex legal research** — multi-jurisdiction compliance analysis, regulatory deep-dives, or when the legal reasoning itself is the deliverable.

**Use `"agent team max"` for high-stakes legal work** — litigation preparation, M&A due diligence contracts, regulatory compliance for heavily regulated industries, or any legal work where the cost of an error far exceeds the cost of deeper analysis. All settings are maxed for the deepest reasoning. Requires ≥2,000 credits.

## Tips for Better Legal Documents

1. **Specify jurisdiction**: "A contract" is vague. "A Delaware-governed contract for California-based parties" gives CellCog the legal context it needs.

2. **Name the parties clearly**: Include entity types (LLC, Corp, sole proprietor) and locations.

3. **Define the deal terms**: Payment amounts, timelines, equity splits, deliverables — the more specific, the better.

4. **State what clauses matter**: "Include IP assignment, non-compete, and arbitration" focuses the document.

5. **Indicate formality level**: "Standard startup-friendly language" vs. "formal corporate tone" changes the output significantly.
