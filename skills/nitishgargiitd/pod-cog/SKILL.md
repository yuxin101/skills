- **Content quality:** #1 on DeepResearch Bench (Feb 2026) — scripts built on deep reasoning, not surface-level takes
- **Voice quality:** Frontier multi-voice dialogue with natural delivery, emotion, and pacing across distinct speakers

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `cellcog` skill for SDK setup and API calls.

```bash
clawhub install cellcog
```

**Read the cellcog skill first** for SDK setup. This skill shows you what's possible.

**Quick pattern (v1.0+):**
```python
# Fire-and-forget - returns immediately
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your podcast request]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="podcast-task",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode for most podcast content
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## Chat Mode for Podcasts

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Scripts, show notes, interview questions, individual episodes | `"agent"` |
| Season planning, narrative series, comprehensive guest research | `"agent team"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most podcast work.** Episode scripts, show notes, and interview prep execute well in agent mode.

**Use `"agent team"` for deep work** - researching complex guests, planning multi-episode narratives, or developing comprehensive content strategies.

## Full Audio Production

When you request a **full podcast episode with audio**, CellCog produces a complete, ready-to-publish file with this default structure:

```
[Intro Music] → [Dialogue/Conversation] → [Outro Music]
```

**CellCog generates all three parts automatically** — the multi-voice dialogue AND short intro/outro music tracks — then stitches them into one final MP3.

### Customizing the Music

You can control the intro and outro music in your prompt:

**Specific direction:**
> "Intro music: 8 seconds of upbeat electronic, think tech podcast energy. Outro music: 6 seconds of the same theme but softer, winding down."

**Genre/mood direction:**
> "Use jazzy lo-fi intro music and a calm acoustic outro."

**Let CellCog decide:**
> "Choose intro and outro music that fits the topic."

If you say nothing about music, CellCog will choose something appropriate for your topic and tone.

### What You Get

| Component | What CellCog Produces |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Intro music** | ~8 second original track matching your podcast vibe |
| **Dialogue** | Full multi-voice conversation with natural delivery |
| **Outro music** | ~6 second wind-down track |
| **Final file** | Single MP3 with all three concatenated, ready to publish |

### Example with Music Direction

> "Create a 10-minute podcast episode:
> 
> Topic: Why startups should hire generalists first
> Format: Interview between a host and a 3x founder
> Tone: Casual, insightful, with some humor
> 
> Intro music: Upbeat indie rock, 8 seconds, energetic but not overwhelming
> Outro music: Same vibe but mellower, 6 seconds
> 
> Or if you prefer: just say 'Choose music that fits' and CellCog will pick."

## Tips for Better Podcast Content

1. **Know your format**: "Conversational interview" vs "structured interview" changes the prep.

2. **Share your voice**: Give examples of your speaking style so scripts sound like you.

3. **Context on guests**: More background = better, more unique questions.

4. **Specify length**: "25 minutes spoken" helps calibrate script length.

5. **Include CTAs**: Tell us what actions you want listeners to take.

6. **Think about chapters**: Modern podcast apps support chapters. Plan for them.
