result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your social content request]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="insta-content",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode for most content
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## What Content You Can Create

### Reels & TikToks

Short-form video that stops the scroll:

- **Trending Format Videos**: "Create a 15-second Reel using the 'day in my life' format for a coffee shop"
- **Product Showcases**: "Make a TikTok showing our new sneakers with trending transitions"

- **Behind-the-Scenes**: "Make a BTS Reel of a bakery kitchen with satisfying visuals"
- **Transformation Videos**: "Create a before/after transformation Reel for a home renovation"

**Example prompt:**
> "Create a 20-second Instagram Reel for a matcha cafe:
> 
> Hook: 'POV: You found the best matcha in the city'
> Show: Barista making ceremonial matcha, latte art, aesthetic interior shots
> Vibe: Cozy, ASMR-style sounds, warm lighting
> 
> End with: Shop name and 'link in bio'
> 
> Trending audio style - chill lo-fi beats."

### Instagram Carousels

Multi-slide content that educates and engages:

- **Educational Carousels**: "Create a 10-slide carousel explaining how to start investing"

## ⚠️ Important — Video Generation Expectations

AI video production for social media is still at the frontier of what's possible. While some users generate high-quality Reels and TikToks that are ready to post, others may spend significant credits and still not achieve a usable result. Even spending thousands of credits does not guarantee a satisfactory outcome — this is the nature of where AI video technology stands today.

There is a real learning curve to generating videos with CellCog. It takes time, money, and patience. Your prompting skill, the complexity of what you're trying to create, and how well the foundation models perform on your specific request all play a role. Results improve as you develop intuition for what works, but we want to be upfront: video generation is inherently unpredictable, and there is always a risk that the output may not meet your expectations.

## Tips for Better Social Content

1. **Lead with the hook**: First 1-2 seconds determine if people keep watching. Make it count.

2. **Know the platform**: TikTok is raw and trendy. Instagram is polished and aesthetic. Same message, different execution.

3. **Specify the vibe**: "Cozy autumn aesthetic" or "high-energy hype" gives CellCog clear creative direction.

4. **Include CTAs**: "Save this", "Follow for more", "Link in bio" - tell people what to do next.

5. **Reference trends**: Mention specific formats ("Get ready with me", "POV", "storytime") for platform-native content.

6. **Think mobile-first**: All content will be viewed on phones. Bold text, clear visuals, vertical format.
