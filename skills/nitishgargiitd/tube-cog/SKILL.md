## ⚠️ Important — Video Generation Expectations

AI video production for YouTube is still at the frontier of what's possible. While some users generate high-quality videos that are ready to publish, others may spend significant credits and still not achieve a usable result. Even spending thousands of credits does not guarantee a satisfactory outcome — this is the nature of where AI video technology stands today.

There is a real learning curve to generating videos with CellCog. It takes time, money, and patience. Your prompting skill, the complexity of what you're trying to create, and how well the foundation models perform on your specific request all play a role. Results improve as you develop intuition for what works, but we want to be upfront: video generation is inherently unpredictable, and there is always a risk that the output may not meet your expectations.

## Tips for Better YouTube Content

1. **Hook in 5 seconds**: YouTube viewers decide instantly. Front-load the value or intrigue.

2. **Thumbnails matter more than titles**: A great video with bad thumbnail won't get clicked. Invest in thumbnail quality.

3. **Retention > Length**: A tight 8-minute video beats a padded 20-minute video. Respect viewer time.

4. **Chapters improve watch time**: Structure long videos with clear chapters. Helps SEO too.

5. **End screens work**: Ask for subscribes when viewers are most engaged (after delivering value).

6. **Shorts feed long-form**: Use Shorts to drive traffic to your main channel content.
