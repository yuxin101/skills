# Slides Cog - Content Worth Presenting, Design Worth Looking At

**Great slides need two things: content worth presenting and design worth looking at.** CellCog takes both seriously.

- **Content:** #1 on DeepResearch Bench (Feb 2026) — your prompt can be minimal and CellCog will research and fill in the substance mindfully, not just pad slides with filler
- **Design:** State-of-the-art presentation generation — PDF slides or native PPTX, with layouts, typography, and visuals you can present as-is

Pitch decks, keynotes, board presentations, image slideshows — ready to present, not ready to fix.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `cellcog` skill for SDK setup and API calls.

```bash
clawhub install cellcog
```

**Read the cellcog skill first** for SDK setup. This skill shows you what's possible.

**Quick pattern (v1.0+):**
```python
# Fire-and-forget - returns immediately
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your presentation request]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="presentation-task",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode for most presentations
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## Output Formats

CellCog generates presentations in multiple formats. Each has its strengths:

### PDF (Default for Ambiguous Requests)

When you say "create a presentation" or "make a slide deck" without specifying a format, CellCog generates PDF:
- Full control over layout, typography, and design
- Perfect rendering across all devices
- Professional, polished results every time
- Supports images, charts, complex layouts without compromise

### PPTX (First-Class Support)

When you explicitly request PPTX ("create a PowerPoint", "make a .pptx"), CellCog generates native PowerPoint directly:
- Editable slides — your team can modify, reorder, and customize
- Compatible with PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Keynote
- Professional layouts with proper slide masters and formatting
- Great for collaborative workflows where multiple people contribute

**Just ask for PPTX and you'll get it.** No need to justify why you want an editable format.

## Tips for Better Presentations

1. **Specify slide count**: "10-12 slides" helps scope appropriately. Pitch decks are typically 10-15 slides. Training can be 20-30.

2. **List the slides you want**: Even a rough outline helps. "Include: Problem, Solution, Market, Team, Ask."

3. **Provide key content**: Actual metrics, quotes, and facts make better slides than placeholders.

4. **Design direction**: "Minimal and modern", "Corporate professional", "Bold and colorful", specific colors.

5. **Mention the audience**: "For investors", "For technical team", "For executives" changes tone and detail level.

6. **Choose your format**: PDF is the default for polished output. Request PPTX when your team needs to edit or customize the slides.
