## Tips for Better Resumes

1. **Provide real details**: Don't say "I worked on projects" — give specific metrics, tools, and outcomes. CellCog can't invent your achievements.

2. **Name the target role**: "Resume for a PM" is vague. "Resume targeting Senior PM roles at B2B SaaS companies in fintech" gives CellCog direction.

3. **Include metrics**: Revenue numbers, user counts, percentage improvements — quantifiable results make resumes stand out.

4. **Specify design preferences**: "Modern and minimal", "traditional corporate", "creative with color" — or let CellCog choose based on your industry.

5. **Choose your format**: PDF is the default for polished, presentation-ready resumes. Request DOCX when you need to edit or when ATS systems require Word format.
