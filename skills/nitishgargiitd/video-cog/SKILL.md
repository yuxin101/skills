## ⚠️ Important — Video Generation Expectations

Long-form AI video production is still at the frontier of what's possible. While some users generate high-quality, cinematic videos that are ready for production use, others may spend significant credits and still not achieve a usable result. Even spending thousands of credits does not guarantee a satisfactory outcome — this is the nature of where AI video technology stands today.

There is a real learning curve to generating long-form videos with CellCog. It takes time, money, and patience. Your prompting skill, the complexity of what you're trying to create, and how well the foundation models perform on your specific request all play a role. Results improve as you develop intuition for what works, but we want to be upfront: video generation is inherently unpredictable, and there is always a risk that the output may not meet your expectations.

## Tips for Better Videos

1. **Specify duration**: "30 seconds" or "2 minutes" helps scope the content appropriately.

2. **Define aspect ratio**: 16:9 for YouTube/web, 9:16 for TikTok/Reels/Shorts, 1:1 for Instagram feed.

3. **Describe the style**: "Cinematic", "casual UGC", "corporate professional", "playful animated".

4. **Audio preferences**: "Upbeat music", "calm narration", "no audio", "sound effects only".

5. **Include key moments**: Describe the scenes or beats you want to hit.

6. **Provide scripts**: For spokesperson/voiceover videos, write out exactly what should be said.
