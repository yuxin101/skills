## Chat Mode for Stories

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Short stories, scenes, character work, outlines | `"agent"` |
| Complex narratives, novel development, deep world building | `"agent team"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most creative writing.** Short stories, individual scenes, and character development execute well in agent mode.

**Use `"agent team"` for narrative complexity** - novel-length outlines, intricate plot development, or multi-layered world building that benefits from deep thinking.

## Tips for Better Stories

1. **Genre expectations**: Readers have expectations. Honor them or subvert them intentionally, but know what they are.

2. **Character drives plot**: Give CellCog clear character motivations. Plot emerges from characters wanting things.

3. **Specific details**: "A coffee shop" is generic. "A coffee shop with mismatched furniture and a cat named Hemingway" is memorable.

4. **Emotional truth**: Even in fantasy, the emotions should feel real. Specify the emotional journey you want.

5. **Show, don't tell**: Ask for scenes, not summaries. "Write the moment she realizes..." not "Describe that she was sad."

6. **Iterate**: First drafts are starting points. Use CellCog to revise, expand, and refine.
