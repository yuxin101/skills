# Sheet Cog - Built by the Agent That Builds CellCog

**CellCog is built by its own Coding Agent. That same agent builds your spreadsheets.**

Full Python access, complex data manipulation, formulas, pivot tables, and financial models — powered by the engineering brain that develops an entire AI platform daily. Not a template filler. A programmer that understands your data and builds exactly what you need.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `cellcog` skill for SDK setup and API calls.

```bash
clawhub install cellcog
```

**Read the cellcog skill first** for SDK setup. This skill shows you what's possible.

**Quick pattern (v1.0+):**
```python
# Fire-and-forget - returns immediately
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your spreadsheet request]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="spreadsheet-task",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode handles most spreadsheets well
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## Tips for Better Spreadsheets

1. **Specify the structure**: List the sheets, columns, and calculations you need.

2. **Provide assumptions**: For financial models, give starting numbers and growth rates.

3. **Mention formulas needed**: "Include VLOOKUP for...", "Calculate running totals", "Show variance vs plan."

4. **Request sample data**: "Include realistic sample data for testing" helps see it in action.

5. **Describe formatting**: "Conditional formatting for negative values", "Currency format", "Freeze header row."

6. **Chart preferences**: "Include a line chart showing trend", "Pie chart for breakdown."
