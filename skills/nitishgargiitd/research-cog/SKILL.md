## What You Can Research

### Competitive Analysis

Analyze companies against their competitors with structured insights:

- **Company vs. Competitors**: "Compare Stripe vs Square vs Adyen - market positioning, pricing, features, strengths/weaknesses"
- **SWOT Analysis**: "Create a SWOT analysis for Shopify in the e-commerce platform market"
- **Market Positioning**: "How does Notion position itself against Confluence, Coda, and Obsidian?"
- **Feature Comparison**: "Compare the AI capabilities of Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho CRM"

### Market Research

Understand markets, industries, and trends:

- **Industry Analysis**: "Analyze the electric vehicle market in Europe - size, growth, key players, trends"
- **Market Sizing**: "What's the TAM/SAM/SOM for AI-powered customer service tools in North America?"
- **Trend Analysis**: "What are the emerging trends in sustainable packaging for 2026?"
- **Customer Segments**: "Identify and profile the key customer segments for premium pet food"
- **Regulatory Landscape**: "Research FDA regulations for AI-powered medical devices"

### Stock & Investment Analysis

Financial research with data and analysis:

- **Company Fundamentals**: "Analyze NVIDIA's financials - revenue growth, margins, competitive moat"

- **Sector Analysis**: "Compare semiconductor stocks - NVDA, AMD, INTC, TSM"
- **Risk Assessment**: "What are the key risks for Tesla investors in 2026?"
- **Earnings Analysis**: "Summarize Apple's Q4 2025 earnings and forward guidance"

### Academic & Technical Research

Deep dives with proper citations:

- **Literature Review**: "Research the current state of quantum error correction techniques"
- **Technology Deep Dive**: "Explain transformer architectures and their evolution from attention mechanisms"
- **Scientific Topics**: "What's the latest research on CRISPR gene editing for cancer treatment?"
- **Historical Analysis**: "Research the history and impact of the Bretton Woods system"

### Due Diligence

Comprehensive research for decision-making:

- **Startup Due Diligence**: "Research [Company Name] - founding team, funding, product, market, competitors"

## Research Output Formats

CellCog can deliver research in multiple formats:

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Interactive HTML Report** | Explorable dashboards with charts, expandable sections |
| **PDF Report** | Shareable, printable professional documents |
| **Markdown** | Integration into your docs/wikis |
| **Plain Response** | Quick answers in chat |

Specify your preferred format in the prompt:
- "Create an interactive HTML report on..."
- "Generate a PDF research report analyzing..."
- "Give me a markdown summary of..."

## Chat Mode for Research

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Trivial lookups, basic facts | `"agent"` |
| Deep research, competitive analysis, market research, investment analysis | `"agent team"` |
| Cutting-edge academic research, high-stakes due diligence, institutional-grade analysis | `"agent team max"` |

**Use `"agent team"` for most research** (the default). Agent team mode enables multi-source research, cross-referencing, citation verification, and deeper analysis with multiple reasoning passes.

**Use `"agent"` only for trivial lookups** like "What's Apple's stock ticker?"

**Use `"agent team max"` for cutting-edge academic research and high-stakes due diligence** — when the research directly informs costly decisions (investment thesis, M&A, regulatory compliance, PhD-level analysis). All settings maxed for the deepest reasoning. The quality gain is incremental but meaningful when accuracy is critical. Requires ≥2,000 credits.

## Research Quality Features

### Citations (On Request)

**Citations are NOT automatic.** CellCog focuses on delivering accurate, well-researched content by default.

If you need citations:
- **Explicitly request them**: "Include citations for all factual claims with source URLs"
- **Specify format**: "Provide citations as footnotes" or "Include a references section at the end"
- **Indicate placement**: "Citations inline" vs "Citations in appendix"

Without explicit citation requests, CellCog prioritizes delivering accurate information efficiently.

### Data Accuracy
CellCog cross-references multiple sources for financial and statistical data, ensuring accuracy even without explicit citations.

### Structured Analysis
Complex research is organized with clear sections, executive summaries, and actionable insights.

### Visual Elements
Research reports can include:
- Charts and graphs
- Comparison tables
- Timeline visualizations
- Market maps

## Tips for Better Research

1. **Be specific**: "AI market" is vague. "Enterprise AI automation market in healthcare" is better.

2. **Specify timeframe**: "Recent" is ambiguous. "2025-2026" or "last 6 months" is clearer.

3. **Define scope**: "Compare everything about X and Y" leads to bloat. "Compare X and Y on pricing, features, and market positioning" is focused.

4. **Request structure**: "Include executive summary, key findings, and recommendations" helps organize output.

5. **Mention output format**: "Deliver as PDF" or "Create interactive HTML dashboard" gets you the right format.
