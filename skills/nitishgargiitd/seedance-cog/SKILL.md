## Tips for Better Videos

1. **Describe the story**: "A video about our app" → "A 60-second video showing a stressed founder discovering our app, their workflow transforming, ending with them confidently presenting to investors"

2. **Specify duration**: "30-second social ad" vs. "2-minute explainer" sets the pacing.

3. **Set the mood**: "Upbeat and energetic", "calm and professional", "dramatic and cinematic"

4. **Mention music preferences**: "Uplifting corporate background", "lo-fi beats", "cinematic orchestral" — or let CellCog choose.

5. **For spokesperson videos**: Describe the presenter's appearance and tone of voice.
