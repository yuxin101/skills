## Chat Mode for Dashboards

Choose based on complexity:

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Standard dashboards, KPI trackers, data visualizations, charts | `"agent"` |
| Complex interactive apps, games, novel data explorers | `"agent team"` |

**Default to `"agent"`** for most dashboard requests. CellCog's agent mode handles charts, tables, filters, and interactivity efficiently.

Reserve `"agent team"` for truly complex applications requiring significant design thinking—like building a novel game mechanic or a highly customized analytical tool with multiple interconnected features.

## Tips for Better Dashboards

1. **Prioritize key metrics**: Don't cram everything. Lead with the 3-5 most important KPIs.

2. **Describe the data**: What columns exist? What do they mean? What time period?

3. **Specify chart types**: "Line chart for trends, bar chart for comparisons, pie for composition."

4. **Include interactivity**: "Filter by date range", "Click to drill down", "Hover for details."

5. **Design direction**: "Modern minimal", "Corporate professional", "Playful and colorful", specific color schemes.

6. **Responsive needs**: "Desktop only" vs "Must work on mobile."
