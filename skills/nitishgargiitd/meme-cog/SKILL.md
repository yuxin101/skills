# Meme Cog - Deep Reasoning Meets Internet Culture

**The hardest creative challenge in AI, powered by the deepest reasoning.** #1 on DeepResearch Bench (Feb 2026).

Comedy requires timing, cultural awareness, subverted expectations, and an understanding of what makes humans laugh. CellCog applies frontier-level reasoning to research trends, craft multiple angles, and curate only what's genuinely funny.

We're honest: our hit rate is maybe 60-70%. Great memes are hard for humans too. But deep reasoning + multi-variant generation + ruthless curation = memes that actually land.

## The Honesty Section

Let's be real about what's hard:

| Challenge | Why It's Hard | What We Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Timing** | Comedy relies on rhythm and surprise | We study meme structures |
| **Cultural Context** | Memes are deeply referential | We track internet culture |
| **Freshness** | Old jokes aren't funny | We avoid overused formats |
| **Subjectivity** | Humor is personal | We offer variations |

**Our success rate:** Maybe 60-70% land. That's honest. Great memes are hard for humans too.

**What helps us:**
- Clear target audience
- Specific cultural references
- Well-defined format
- Your feedback

**Use `chat_mode="agent"`** for meme creation.

Memes are quick creative bursts, not deep deliberation. Agent mode's faster iteration matches meme culture's rapid pace.

## Example Prompts

**Classic format:**
> "Create an 'Expanding Brain' meme about making coffee:
> 
> Level 1: Making instant coffee
> Level 2: Using a drip machine
> Level 3: Pour-over with precise measurements
> Level 4: Growing your own beans on a mountain
> 
> Target: Coffee enthusiasts who've gone too deep"

**Programmer humor:**
> "Create a meme about git merge conflicts:
> 
> Format: Any format that fits
> Audience: Developers
> Tone: The shared pain of merge conflict resolution
> 
> Make it relatable to anyone who's had to resolve a 500-line conflict"

**Original concept:**
> "Create a reaction image for:
> 
> Situation: When your 'quick fix' actually works
> Expression: Suspicious disbelief mixed with relief
> 
> Should work as a standalone reaction image people would share"

**Community-specific:**
> "Create a meme for the indie game dev community:
> 
> Topic: Scope creep
> The journey from 'simple puzzle game' to 'MMO with procedural narrative'
> 
> Make it hit close to home for anyone who's been there"

## Tips for Better Memes

1. **Know your audience**: A meme that kills in r/ProgrammerHumor might flop on Instagram. Specify who it's for.

2. **Reference correctly**: If you want a specific meme format, name it. "Drake format" is clearer than "that two-panel thing."

3. **Embrace specificity**: "Programmer meme" is vague. "Meme about debugging production at 2 AM" has hooks.

4. **Current events help**: Timely memes hit harder. Reference what's happening now.

5. **Iterate**: First meme attempt not funny? Tell us why and we'll adjust. Comedy is iterative.

6. **The rule of threes**: Many memes follow escalating patterns. Sets of three often work well.

## A Note on Expectations

We're not going to pretend AI comedy is solved. It isn't.

What we can do:
- Generate meme formats reliably
- Understand cultural references
- Produce variations quickly
- Learn from feedback

What's still hard:
- Genuine surprise and novelty
- Perfect comedic timing
- Knowing when NOT to explain a joke
- Creating the next viral format

**Use meme-cog as a collaborator, not a magic humor machine.** Your sense of what's funny + our generation capabilities = better results than either alone.

We're working on it. Comedy is hard. Thanks for exploring the frontier with us.
