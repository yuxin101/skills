# Brand Cog - Build Brands, Not Just Logos

**Other tools make logos. CellCog builds brands.** #1 on DeepResearch Bench (Feb 2026) for deep strategic reasoning + the widest modality coverage in AI.

Brand building demands two things: deep understanding of your positioning, audience, and competitors — and the ability to produce assets across every format. CellCog delivers both in one request: logos, color systems, typography, brand guidelines, social templates, web assets, and video, all cohesive from a single brief.

# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## Why Branding is Complex Work

A brand isn't just a logo. It's a system:

- **Visual Consistency**: Every touchpoint must feel cohesive
- **Strategic Positioning**: Design reflects brand personality and values
- **Versatility**: Works across social media, print, web, merchandise
- **Memorability**: Distinctive enough to stick in minds
- **Scalability**: From favicon to billboard

CellCog creates complete brand systems, not just isolated assets.

## Chat Mode for Branding

## Tips for Better Branding

1. **Know your audience**: "For enterprise clients" vs "for Gen Z" changes everything.

2. **Personality over pretty**: A distinctive brand beats a generic beautiful one.

3. **Competition context**: Tell us who you're competing with so we differentiate.

4. **Versatility matters**: Request assets that work across different contexts and sizes.

5. **Include anti-examples**: "Not corporate" or "avoid clinical feel" is useful direction.

6. **Think long-term**: Your brand should have room to evolve. Don't over-constrain.
