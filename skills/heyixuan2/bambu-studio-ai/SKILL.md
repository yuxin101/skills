---

## First-Time Setup

**If `config.json` does not exist in the skill directory, walk the user through setup via conversation before running any commands.**

### Phase 1: Configure

Ask these in order. Be conversational, not robotic.

**1. Printer Model**
> "Which Bambu Lab printer do you have?"

Show options grouped by series:
- 🟢 **A Series** (Entry): A1 Mini (180³mm, 500mm/s), A1 (256³mm, 500mm/s)
- 🔵 **P Series** (Prosumer): P1S (256³mm, 500mm/s, enclosed), P2S (256³mm, 600mm/s)
- 🟠 **X Series** (Pro): X1C (256³mm, AI features), X1E (Industrial, HEPA)
- 🔴 **H Series** (High-end): H2C (350°C, heated chamber), H2S (340³mm, 1000mm/s), H2D (dual extruder, laser, cutting)

**2. Connection Mode**
> "How is your printer connected?"
> 
> **🔌 LAN (Recommended)** — If your computer and printer are on the same WiFi/network.
> Full features: camera, G-code, AMS, AI monitoring, fast response.
> You'll need: IP address, serial number, and access code from printer Settings → Device.
> Also make sure LAN Mode is turned ON on the printer (Settings → Network → LAN Mode → ON).
>
> **☁️ Cloud** — If you're accessing remotely (not on the same network).
> Limited features: no camera, no G-code, no AI monitoring. Requires email verification.

Default to LAN unless user specifically needs remote access.

- **LAN** → printer IP + serial + access code (Settings → Device → LAN Access Code)
- **Cloud** → email + password (will require verification code on first login)
- **Both** → collect all, default to LAN

**3. AI 3D Generation** (optional)
> "Want AI 3D model generation? Create printable models from text or photos."

If yes → pick provider + API key:
- **Meshy** — Most mature, STL/3MF, $20/mo
- **Tripo3D** — Python SDK, $10/mo  
- **Printpal** — Print-optimized output
- **3D AI Studio** — Early access

**4. Notifications**
> "How should I notify you? Auto (match your channel), Discord, iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Slack?"

**5. AI Print Monitoring** (optional)
> "Want AI monitoring? I'll photograph prints and check for failures."

If yes → interval (default 120s), auto-pause on anomaly (default no)

**6. Save Configuration**

Write `config.json` (non-sensitive, shareable):
```json
{
  "model": "H2D",
  "mode": "cloud",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "device_id": "",
  "printer_ip": "",
  "serial": "",
  "3d_provider": "meshy",
  "notify_channel": "auto",
  "monitor_enabled": false,
  "monitor_interval": 120,
  "auto_pause": false
}
```

Write `.secrets.json` (sensitive, **use these exact keys**):
```json
{
  "password": "bambu_account_password",
  "access_code": "printer_lan_access_code",
  "3d_api_key": "generation_api_key"
}
```

Then run:
```bash
chmod 600 .secrets.json
```

Ensure `.gitignore` includes `.secrets.json` and `config.json`.

### Phase 2: Verify (ask permission)

> "Config saved! I'd like to run quick tests — no prints will start, no significant API costs. OK?"

**Only proceed if user agrees.**

| Test | Command | When |
|------|---------|------|
| Printer connection | `python3 scripts/bambu.py status` | Always |
| Camera snapshot | `python3 scripts/bambu.py snapshot` | Local mode only |
| AMS status | `python3 scripts/bambu.py ams` | Local mode only |
| 3D API test | `python3 scripts/generate.py text "10mm cube" --raw` | If 3D gen configured (ask first) |
| Bambu Studio | `brew list --cask bambu-studio` | macOS only |

If Bambu Studio not installed, offer: `brew install --cask bambu-studio`

### Phase 3: Summary

```
🎉 Setup Complete!

🖨️ Printer:     H2D (350×320×325mm, 600mm/s)

## Model Sourcing (Search Before Generating)

**When a user wants to print something, always ask first:**

> "Do you want me to:
> 1. 🔎 **Search online** — find existing models (usually higher quality, tested by community)
> 2. 🎨 **AI Generate** — create a custom model from scratch
> 3. 🤷 **Not sure** — I'll search first, generate if nothing fits"

Then follow the appropriate flow. Don't assume — the user may already have a specific design in mind,
or may want something completely custom that doesn't exist.

### Search Priority

| Source | URL | Best For |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **Printables** | printables.com | Bambu Lab community, pre-sliced profiles |
| **Thingiverse** | thingiverse.com | Largest library, everything |
| **MakerWorld** | makerworld.com | Bambu Lab official, ready-to-print |
| **Thangs** | thangs.com | 3D search engine, searches multiple sites |
| **MyMiniFactory** | myminifactory.com | Curated, high quality |
| **Cults3D** | cults3d.com | Designer models, some paid |

### When to Search vs Generate

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Common object (phone stand, hook, box) | **Search first** — 99% chance it exists |
| Specific product accessory (iPhone 15 case) | **Search first** — likely exists with exact dimensions |
| Custom/unique object | **Generate** with AI |
| Artistic/decorative | **Search first**, generate if nothing fits |
| Mechanical/functional part | **Search first** — tested designs > AI guesses |

### Search Flow

1. Ask user: "Want me to search for existing models first? Often better quality than AI-generated."
2. If yes → search Thangs/Printables/MakerWorld via web_search
3. Present top 3-5 results with:
   - Name, thumbnail URL, download count/rating
   - File format (prefer .3mf > .stl)
   - Whether it has Bambu Lab print profiles
4. If user picks one → download → `analyze.py` → preview → print
5. If nothing good → fall back to AI generation

### Example

> User: "Print me a headphone stand"
> Agent: "Let me search — headphone stands are very common online."
> → Searches Printables + MakerWorld
> Agent: "Found 3 good options:
> 1. ⭐ 'Minimal Headphone Stand' — 4.8★, 12K downloads, has Bambu profile
> 2. 'Under-desk Hook Stand' — 4.6★, wall-mounted
> 3. 'RGB Headphone Holder' — with cable channel
>
> Want one of these, or should I generate a custom design?"

---

## Pre-Generation Flow

**Before generating any 3D model, follow these steps. Do NOT skip.**

### Step 1: Clarify Requirements

Ask about anything unclear:

| Ask about | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Dimensions | "How big?" — must fit build volume |
| Purpose | Functional vs decorative → affects wall thickness |
| Material | PLA/TPU/ABS → affects design constraints |
| Phone/device model | If it's a case/holder → need exact dimensions |
| Features | Cable holes, mounting points, adjustable angles |

Example:
> User: "Print me a phone stand"  
> Agent: "Sure! Quick questions:  
> 1. Which phone? (affects holder width)  
> 2. Viewing angle? (15°, 45°, upright?)  
> 3. Any features? (cable hole, non-slip base?)  
> 4. Material preference?"

### Step 2: Research Unknown Objects (ask permission)

If you don't know exact dimensions or appearance:

> User: "Print an iPhone 15 Pro Max case"  
> Agent: "I'll need the exact dimensions for a proper fit. Mind if I look them up?"

After research, confirm:
> "iPhone 15 Pro Max: 159.9 × 76.7 × 8.25mm, camera bump 40 × 36mm.  
> I'll add 1mm tolerance per side. Sound right?"

**What to research:**
- Physical dimensions of real objects
- Tolerance/clearance for cases (typically 0.5–1mm)
- Standard sizes (screws, USB ports, cables)
- Reference images for complex shapes

### Step 3: Confirm Before Generating

> "Here's what I'll generate:  
> - iPhone 15 Pro Max case  
> - 162 × 79 × 12mm (1mm tolerance)  
> - Camera cutout: 42 × 38mm  
> - Material: TPU (flexible)  
> - Est. print time: ~2h  
>  
> Ready to generate?"

### Step 4: Generate

**Before generating, tell the user:**
> "A quick heads-up: AI-generated 3D model quality depends mainly on two things:
> 1. Your 3D generation provider (Meshy, Tripo, etc.) — each has different strengths
> 2. How detailed your prompt is — the more specific, the better
> 
> AI-generated models are not production-ready out of the box. Always review in Bambu Studio.
> If the result isn't great, try a different provider or refine your prompt."

Call `generate.py` with a detailed, dimensions-aware prompt. The script auto-enhances prompts with printability instructions and scales to your printer's build volume.

Use `--raw` to skip auto-enhancement if you've crafted a precise prompt.

## Connection Modes

> **⚠️ Recommendation: Use LAN mode whenever possible.**
> Cloud mode has limited features and requires email verification on every login.
> LAN mode is faster, has full features, and no auth headaches.

### 🔌 Local / LAN (Recommended)

**Requirements:** OpenClaw host and Bambu Lab printer on the **same local network** (WiFi or Ethernet).

**How to enable LAN mode on your printer:**
1. On printer touchscreen → **Settings** → **Network** → **LAN Mode**
2. Toggle **LAN Mode** to **ON** (Live)
3. Note down:
   - **IP Address** — shown on the network screen
   - **Serial Number** — Settings → Device Info
   - **Access Code** — Settings → Device Info → LAN Access Code

```bash
export BAMBU_MODE="local"
export BAMBU_IP="192.168.1.100"        # Your printer's IP
export BAMBU_SERIAL="01P00A000000000"   # From Device Info
export BAMBU_ACCESS_CODE="12345678"     # From Device Info
```

### ☁️ Cloud (remote access only)

Only use Cloud mode if you **cannot** be on the same network as the printer.

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No camera snapshots
- ❌ No G-code commands
- ❌ Limited AMS info
- ❌ Requires email verification code on first login (and after token expires)
- ⚠️ Slower response, depends on Bambu servers

**Login includes verification code flow:**
1. Script sends login request
2. Bambu emails you a verification code
3. Enter the code when prompted (script will **wait patiently** — no auto-retry)
4. Token is cached for 24 hours

```bash
export BAMBU_MODE="cloud"
export BAMBU_EMAIL="you@email.com"
export BAMBU_PASSWORD="password"
```

| Feature | Cloud | LAN |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Status / Control | ✅ | ✅ |
| Camera Snapshot | ❌ | ✅ |
| AMS Full Details | ❌ | ✅ |
| G-code Send | ❌ | ✅ |
| AI Monitoring | ❌ | ✅ |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Auth | Email + verify code | Access code (one-time) |
| Network | Anywhere | Same LAN |

Scripts auto-load `config.json` + `.secrets.json` from the skill directory.
Environment variables override config file values.

---

## Configuration Files

### config.json (non-sensitive, shareable)
See `config/config.example.json` for template.

### .secrets.json (sensitive, chmod 600)
See `config/.secrets.example.json` for template.
**Exact keys:** `password`, `access_code`, `3d_api_key`

### .gitignore
Ships with the skill. Excludes `.secrets.json` and `config.json`.

---

## 3D Generation

Supports 4 providers:

| Provider | Text→3D | Image→3D | Best Format | Price |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Meshy** | ✅ | ✅ | STL/3MF | Free + $20/mo |
| **Tripo3D** | ✅ | ✅ | GLB/STL | Free + $10/mo |
| **Printpal** | ✅ | ✅ | STL | Print-optimized |
| **3D AI Studio** | ✅ | ✅ | STL/OBJ | Early access |

### Auto Prompt Enhancement
User says "a phone stand" → script auto-adds:
> "...Optimized for FDM 3D printing. Max 230×230×230mm. Flat base, watertight mesh, no overhangs >45°, min 1.5mm walls."

### Auto Size Limiting
Models auto-constrained to printer build volume (10% margin):

| Printer | Max Printable |
|---------|--------------|
| A1 Mini | 162×162×162mm |
| A1/P1S/P2S/X1C/X1E/H2C | 230×230×230mm |
| H2S | 306×288×306mm |
| H2D | 315×288×292mm |

Skip enhancement: `--raw` flag.

### Output Format Priority

Always generate in Bambu Lab compatible formats, in this order:

| Priority | Format | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 1st | **.3mf** | Bambu Lab native, preserves print settings |
| 2nd | **.stl** | Universal, all slicers support it |
| 3rd | **.step/.stp** | Precise geometry, editable in CAD |
| 4th | **.obj** | Fallback only |

Default `--format 3mf` unless user specifies otherwise.

### Mandatory Pre-Print Pipeline

**NEVER send a model directly to the printer. Always follow this order:**

```
1. Generate/Download → model.3mf
2. Analyze + Repair  → python3 scripts/analyze.py model.3mf --repair --material PLA
3. Report to user    → "Score 8/10, repaired 58K non-manifold edges..."
4. Open in Bambu Studio → open -a "BambuStudio" model.3mf
5. ⚠️ MANDATORY: Tell user to inspect in Bambu Studio
   → "I've opened the model in Bambu Studio. Please check:
      - Does it look correct? Any missing or deformed parts?
      - Any floating/disconnected pieces? (they will fall during printing!)
      - Is the size right? (check dimensions in bottom bar)
      - Any red warnings? (non-manifold, intersecting parts)
      - Are there parts hanging in the air that need supports?
      - Slice it and check: estimated time, filament usage, and support amount.
      Let me know when you're ready to print!"
6. WAIT for explicit user confirmation → "looks good" / "print it" / "go ahead"
7. Print             → python3 scripts/bambu.py print model.3mf
```

**⛔ NEVER skip step 5-6. NEVER auto-print without user seeing the model in Bambu Studio.**
AI-generated models frequently have mesh errors (non-manifold edges, holes, intersections).
The user MUST visually verify before printing.

#### The 10-Point Printability Check

| # | Check | What It Does |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Dimensional tolerance | Verifies +0.2mm clearance for mating parts |
| 2 | Wall thickness | Must be ≥1.2mm (≥1.6mm for TPU, ≥2.0mm for PEEK) |
| 3 | Load direction | Warns if stress axis aligns with layer lines |
| 4 | Overhang detection | Flags faces >45° that need support |
| 5 | Print orientation | Checks for flat base / bed adhesion |
| 6 | Layer height | Recommends 0.12/0.20/0.28mm based on detail |
| 7 | Infill rate | 15% decorative / 30% functional / custom |
| 8 | Wall count | ≥3 standard, ≥4 functional |
| 9 | Top layers | ≥5 for clean top surface |
| 10 | Material compatibility | Checks printer supports the material |

Also checks: watertight mesh, manifold geometry, build volume fit.

Output includes recommended print settings (layer height, infill, walls, temps, supports).

See `references/3d-prompt-guide.md` for detailed prompt engineering tips.

### Reference Documents

The `references/` folder contains docs the agent can consult:
- `bambu-mqtt-protocol.md` — MQTT topics, commands, report fields
- `bambu-cloud-api.md` — Cloud API Python SDK methods
- `3d-generation-apis.md` — Meshy/Tripo/Printpal/3DAI endpoints
- `3d-prompt-guide.md` — Prompt engineering for printable 3D models
- `model-specs.md` — All 9 printer specs in one table

## AI Print Monitoring

### ⚠️ Requires User Consent

**Always ask before enabling:**
> "Want AI print monitoring? I'll photograph your print and use AI to check for failures."

If yes, ask monitoring intensity:
> "How closely should I monitor? This affects token usage:
> - 🟢 **Light** (every 30 min) — ~2 tokens/hr, good for long prints
> - 🟡 **Standard** (every 5 min) — ~12 tokens/hr, recommended
> - 🔴 **Intensive** (every 2 min) — ~30 tokens/hr, for critical prints or new materials
> - ⚫ **Off** — no monitoring

> Which level?"

Then: "Should I auto-pause if I detect something serious like spaghetti or bed detachment?"

**Never auto-enable.**

### Anomaly Detection

| Type | Severity | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Stringing | ⚠️ Low | Continue, clean after |
| Warping | ⚠️ Medium | Monitor closely |
| Layer Shift | ❌ High | Recommend pause |
| Detachment | ❌ Critical | Pause immediately |
| Spaghetti | ❌ Critical | Pause immediately |
| Clog | ❌ Critical | Pause and inspect |

### Flow
```
monitor.py captures snapshot → outputs image path
    ↓
Agent analyzes image (via image tool)
    ↓
Normal → log, continue
Suspicious → shorten interval, watch
Critical → notify user + optional auto-pause
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Cloud login failed | Check email/password, enter verification code when prompted |
| Cloud verification spam | Don't retry — wait patiently for code, enter once |
| SSL handshake error (LAN) | Normal with newer firmware (self-signed certs). Script auto-handles this. |
| API method not found | Run `pip3 install --upgrade bambulabs-api` — v2.6.6+ renamed many methods (e.g. get_progress→get_percentage, get_gcode_state→get_current_state). Skill is tested against v2.6.6. |
| Can't connect (LAN) | 1) LAN Mode ON on printer 2) IP correct 3) Same WiFi/network as OpenClaw |
| Auth failed | Wrong serial or access code (check Settings → Device on printer) |
| Timeout | Wake printer (tap touchscreen), check if printer IP changed |
| Token expired | Auto-handled — re-authenticates after 24h cache expires |

### Print Failures

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| First layer not sticking | Raise bed temp 5°C, calibrate Z offset |
| Stringing | Lower nozzle temp 5–10°C |
| Warping | Raise bed temp, disable chamber fan |
| Clog | Raise temp, clean nozzle, check moisture |
| AMS feed failure | Check spool tangle, re-feed |

## Automation Ideas

- **Progress updates** — Cron push to user's channel every 30 min
- **AMS low filament alert** — Warn below 20%
- **Timelapse** — Snapshot every 2 min → ffmpeg video
- **Print complete notification** — Alert + final photo
- **Anomaly detection** — AI analysis → auto-pause + alert
