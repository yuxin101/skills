## Character dossier

Required fields:
- name
- role
- appearance
- personality
- behavior logic
- goals
- secrets
- relationships
- growth arc
- speech pattern
- OOC red lines
- allowed exceptions
- function in story
- canon status (locked | soft | provisional)

## Chapter beat sheet

Required fields:
- chapter number
- chapter goal
- viewpoint
- time / place
- opening state
- conflict
- emotional movement
- key dialogue
- ending hook
- state deltas
- forbidden deviations
- relevant canon slice
- unresolved plot loops

## Recovery checkpoint

Use this when a chapter is truncated or a draft must be resumed.

Required fields:
- resume mode
- last stable sentence or beat
- known canon facts
- unknowns that must not be invented
- partial draft source
- next action
- user confirmation required

`state/current.json` should mirror the latest recovery checkpoint in a compact form so resume flows do not need to reconstruct it from multiple prose files. Treat it as a required write target after each accepted chapter.

## Review checklist

Check:
- bootstrap gate status
- canon consistency
- character consistency
- style consistency
- timeline consistency
- pacing
- hook strength
- beat adherence
- plot continuity
- whether any hard fact changed without author confirmation
- whether the resume state matches the last reliable checkpoint
