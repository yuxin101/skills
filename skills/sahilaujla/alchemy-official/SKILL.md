# AI + Alchemy API Integration Guide

## Summary
A self-contained guide for AI agents integrating Alchemy APIs using an API key. This file alone should be enough to ship a basic integration. Use the reference files for depth, edge cases, and advanced workflows.

## Before Making Any Request

1. Check if `$ALCHEMY_API_KEY` is set (e.g., `echo $ALCHEMY_API_KEY`).
2. If **not set**, do NOT proceed with API-key URLs. **Use the `agentic-gateway` skill instead** — it requires no API key.
3. If set, use the Base URLs + Auth table below.

## Do This First
1. Choose the right product using the Endpoint Selector below.
2. Use the Base URLs + Auth table for the correct endpoint and headers.
3. Copy a Quickstart example and test against a testnet first.

## Base URLs + Auth (Cheat Sheet)

## One-File Quickstart (Copy/Paste)

> **No API key?** Use the `agentic-gateway` skill instead. Replace API-key URLs with `https://x402.alchemy.com/rpc/eth-mainnet` and add `Authorization: SIWE <token>`. See the `agentic-gateway` skill for setup.

### EVM JSON-RPC (Read)
```bash
curl -s https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/$ALCHEMY_API_KEY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[]}'
```

### Token Balances
```bash
curl -s https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/$ALCHEMY_API_KEY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"alchemy_getTokenBalances","params":["0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa"]}'
```

### Transfer History
```bash
curl -s https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/$ALCHEMY_API_KEY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"alchemy_getAssetTransfers","params":[{"fromBlock":"0x0","toBlock":"latest","toAddress":"0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa","category":["erc20"],"withMetadata":true,"maxCount":"0x3e8"}]}'
```

### NFT Ownership
```bash
curl -s "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/nft/v3/$ALCHEMY_API_KEY/getNFTsForOwner?owner=0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa"
```

### Prices (Spot)
```bash
curl -s "https://api.g.alchemy.com/prices/v1/$ALCHEMY_API_KEY/tokens/by-symbol?symbols=ETH&symbols=USDC"
```

### Prices (Historical)
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.g.alchemy.com/prices/v1/$ALCHEMY_API_KEY/tokens/historical" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol":"ETH","startTime":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","endTime":"2024-01-02T00:00:00Z"}'
```

### Create Notify Webhook
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://dashboard.alchemy.com/api/create-webhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Alchemy-Token: $ALCHEMY_NOTIFY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"network":"ETH_MAINNET","webhook_type":"ADDRESS_ACTIVITY","webhook_url":"https://example.com/webhook","addresses":["0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa"]}'
```

### Verify Webhook Signature (Node)
```ts
import crypto from "crypto";

export function verify(rawBody: string, signature: string, secret: string) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(rawBody).digest("hex");
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(hmac), Buffer.from(signature));
}
```

## Network Naming Rules
- Data APIs and JSON-RPC use lowercase network enums like `eth-mainnet`.
- Notify API uses uppercase enums like `ETH_MAINNET`.

## Pagination + Limits (Cheat Sheet)
| Endpoint | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alchemy_getTokenBalances` | `maxCount` <= 100 | Use `pageKey` for pagination. |
| `alchemy_getAssetTransfers` | `maxCount` default `0x3e8` | Use `pageKey` for pagination. |
| Portfolio token balances | 3 address/network pairs, 20 networks total | `pageKey` supported. |
| Portfolio NFTs | 2 address/network pairs, 15 networks each | `pageKey` supported. |
| Prices by address | 25 addresses, 3 networks | POST body `addresses[]`. |
| Transactions history (beta) | 1 address/network pair, 2 networks | ETH and BASE mainnets only. |

## Common Token Addresses
| Token | Chain | Address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ETH | ethereum | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| WETH | ethereum | `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` |
| USDC | ethereum | `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eB48` |
| USDC | base | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` |

## Failure Modes + Retries
- HTTP `429` means rate limit. Use exponential backoff with jitter.
- JSON-RPC errors come in `error` fields even with HTTP 200.
- Use `pageKey` to resume pagination after failures.
- De-dupe websocket events on reconnect.
