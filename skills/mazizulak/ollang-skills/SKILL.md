This is the entry point for all Ollang API operations. Based on the user's intent, delegate to the appropriate sub-skill below.

## Sub-Skills

| `ollang-health` | User wants to check if the API is up |
| `ollang-upload` | User wants to upload a video, audio, document, or VTT file |
| `ollang-order-create` | User wants to create a translation, CC, subtitle, or dubbing order |
| `ollang-order-get` | User wants to check the status or details of a specific order |
| `ollang-orders-list` | User wants to list, search, or filter their orders |
| `ollang-order-cancel` | User wants to cancel an order |
| `ollang-order-rerun` | User wants to rerun or regenerate an order |
| `ollang-revision` | User wants to report an issue or manage revisions on an order |

| `ollang-project` | User wants to list or inspect projects |
| `ollang-folder` | User wants to list or find folders |

## Full Workflow

A complete end-to-end translation workflow looks like this:

```
1. Upload file          →  ollang-upload        →  returns projectId
2. Create order         →  ollang-order-create  →  returns orderId(s)
3. Monitor status       →  ollang-order-get     →  poll until "completed"
4. Quality check        →  ollang-qc-eval       →  scores + segment analysis
5. Report issues        →  ollang-revision      →  create revisions if needed
6. Upgrade to human     →  ollang-human-review  →  optional linguist review
```
