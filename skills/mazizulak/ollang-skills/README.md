# Ollang Agent Skills

A collection of skills for interacting with the [Ollang](https://ollang.com) translation platform API via natural language — compatible with any agent that supports the skills standard, including [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Devin](https://devin.ai), and others.

## What are Skills?

Skills are prompt-based extensions for AI agents that trigger automatically based on your intent. Once installed, you can say things like *"upload this video to Ollang"* or *"check my recent orders"* and your agent will know exactly what to do.

---

## Installation

Copy the skill folders into your agent's skills directory:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
cp -r ollang-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Cursor / other agents:** place the skill folders in the skills directory your agent supports (refer to your agent's documentation).

## Authentication

All skills (except `ollang-health`) require an API key from [lab.ollang.com](https://lab.ollang.com).

Pass it as the `X-Api-Key` header — Claude will ask for it if not provided.

---

## API Base URL

All requests go to:
```
https://api-integration.ollang.com
```

---

## Typical Workflow

```
1. ollang-upload     →  upload file, get projectId
2. ollang-order-create →  create order with projectId, get orderId
3. ollang-order-get  →  poll order status
4. ollang-qc-eval    →  run quality check on completed order
5. ollang-revision   →  report any issues
```

## Notes

- Query params using bracket notation (e.g. `pageOptions[page]`) require curl's `-g` flag (`--globoff`) to prevent URL malformat errors. All skills handle this automatically.
- Skills are compatible with any agent that supports the skills standard (Claude Code, Cursor, Devin, etc.).
