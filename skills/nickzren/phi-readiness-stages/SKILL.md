# PHI Readiness Stages

This top-level `SKILL.md` is the canonical install and publish entrypoint for the repository root.

It is suitable for Codex, Claude Code, and OpenClaw-compatible registries that publish a root skill folder directly.

The detailed PRS assessment workflow lives in `skills/phi-readiness-review/SKILL.md`.

If you are using this as an installed or published skill, always load files in this order:

1. `skills/phi-readiness-review/SKILL.md`
2. `framework/assessment-rules.md`
3. `framework/assessment-evidence-handling.md`
4. `framework/applicability-role-matrix.md`
5. `framework/stage-rubric.md`
6. `framework/evidence-levels.md`
7. `framework/evidence-freshness.md`
8. `framework/minimum-artifact-matrix.md`
9. `framework/regulatory-boundaries.md`
10. `framework/output-contract.md`

Then load only the additional control, checklist, and reference files needed for the specific assessment.

When a review needs rule-level traceability or a baseline-versus-policy distinction, also load `mappings/hipaa-security-rule-crosswalk.md`.

If you are using the repository itself as context rather than as an installed skill, start from `AGENTS.md`.
