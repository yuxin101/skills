# Maxxit Lazy Trading

Execute perpetual futures trades on Ostium, Aster DEX, and Avantis DEX through Maxxit's Lazy Trading API. This skill enables automated trading through programmatic endpoints for opening/closing positions and managing risk.

## Built-in Strategy Scripts

The skill includes standalone Python strategy scripts. Use them when the user wants the agent to run a predefined trading system instead of manually specifying each trade.

- `ema-strategy.py`
  - Trend-following EMA crossover on Binance klines using close prices.
- `rsi-bollinger-strategy.py`
  - Mean-reversion system that waits for price to pierce a Bollinger Band and re-enter with RSI confirmation.
- `donchian-adx-strategy.py`
  - Breakout system that trades Donchian channel breaks only when ADX confirms a strong trend regime.
- `taker-strategy.py` - Aggressive Taker (Order Flow) HFT strategy. Analyzes Binance taker buy/sell ratios to detect aggressive market participants and catch rapid momentum shifts.
- `mean-reversion-strategy.py` - RSI + Bollinger Band mean-reversion strategy. A technical approach using price exhaustion points optimized for high-frequency scalping in sideways or boring markets.
- `breakout-strategy.py` - Volatility breakout strategy with ATR filter. Enters trades when price breaks out of a standard deviation channel while ATR confirms increasing volatility and momentum.
- `vwap-strategy.py` - VWAP crossover institutional momentum strategy. Uses volume-weighted average price and EMA to confirm institutional trend alignment and confirm trade strength with volume.

All scripts:
- read Binance kline data directly from `https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines`
- use `MAXXIT_API_URL` and `MAXXIT_API_KEY`
- execute through Maxxit programmatic trading endpoints
- maintain per-symbol, per-venue state in the OpenClaw workspace

Example invocations:

```bash
python3 ema-strategy.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 5m --venue avantis
python3 rsi-bollinger-strategy.py --symbol ETHUSDT --interval 5m --venue ostium
python3 donchian-adx-strategy.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 15m --venue avantis
```

## ⚠️ DEX Routing Rules (Mandatory)

1. **Always ask venue first if unclear**: "Do you want to trade on Ostium, Aster, or Avantis?"
2. **Always state the active venue explicitly** in your response (e.g., "Using Ostium..." or "Using Aster..." or "Using Avantis...").
3. **Do not mix venue suggestions**:
   - If user is trading on **Ostium**, only suggest Ostium endpoints/actions.
   - If user is trading on **Aster**, only suggest Aster endpoints/actions.
   - If user is trading on **Avantis**, only suggest Avantis endpoints/actions.
4. **Do not ask network clarification**:
   - **Ostium defaults to mainnet**, but if the user explicitly asks for **Ostium testnet / Arbitrum Sepolia**, honor that and pass `isTestnet: true` on Ostium endpoints.
   - **Aster is testnet-only** in this setup.
   - **Avantis is mainnet-only** (Base chain) in this setup.
   - Therefore do **not** ask "mainnet or testnet?" unless the user explicitly requests Ostium testnet.
5. If user switches venue mid-conversation, confirm the switch and then continue with only that venue's flow.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: API Parameter Rules (Read Before Calling ANY Endpoint)

> **NEVER assume, guess, or hallucinate values for API request parameters.** Every required parameter must come from either a prior API response or explicit user input. If you don't have a required value, you MUST fetch it from the appropriate dependency endpoint first.

### Parameter Dependency Graph

The following shows where each required parameter comes from. **Always resolve dependencies before calling an endpoint.**

| Parameter | Source | Endpoint to Fetch From |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| `userAddress` / `address` | `/user-details` response → `user_wallet` | `GET /user-details` |
| `agentAddress` | `/user-details` response → `ostium_agent_address` | `GET /user-details` |
| `tradeIndex` | `/open-position` response → `actualTradeIndex` **OR** `/positions` response → `tradeIndex` | `POST /open-position` or `POST /positions` |
| `pairIndex` | `/positions` response → `pairIndex` **OR** `/symbols` response → symbol `id` | `POST /positions` or `GET /symbols` |
| `entryPrice` | `/open-position` response → `entryPrice` **OR** `/positions` response → `entryPrice` | `POST /open-position` or `POST /positions` |
| `market` / `symbol` | User specifies token **OR** `/symbols` response → `symbol` (e.g. `ETH/USD`) | User input or `GET /symbols` |
| `side` | User specifies `"long"` or `"short"` | User input (required) |
| `collateral` | User specifies the USDC amount | User input (required) |
| `leverage` | User specifies the multiplier | User input (required) |
| `takeProfitPercent` | User specifies (e.g., 0.30 = 30%) | User input (required) |
| `stopLossPercent` | User specifies (e.g., 0.10 = 10%) | User input (required) |
| `address` (for copy-trader-trades) | `/copy-traders` response → `creatorWallet` or `walletAddress` | `GET /copy-traders` |
| `commitment` (Alpha) | `/alpha/agents` response → `commitment` | `GET /alpha/agents` |
| `listingId` (Alpha) | `/alpha/listings` response → `listingId` | `GET /alpha/listings` |
| `alpha`, `contentHash` (Alpha) | `/alpha/purchase` Phase 2 response → `alpha`, `contentHash` | `GET /alpha/purchase` + `X-Payment` header |
| `txHash` (Alpha) | `/alpha/pay` response → `txHash` | `POST /alpha/pay` |

### Mandatory Workflow Rules

1. **Always call `/user-details` first** to get `user_wallet` (used as `userAddress`/`address`). Cache it for the session — it doesn't change.
2. **Treat `/user-details` as identity-first.** It always returns `user_wallet` for a valid API key, even if no lazy-trading agent exists yet.
3. **`/user-details` is sparse.** It omits fields that are empty, `null`, or `false`. Missing fields mean “not applicable” and should not be treated as an error or missing configuration by themselves.
4. **Only use `ostium_agent_address` when the venue needs an agent.** Ostium and Avantis require it. Zerodha does not. Aster only needs `user_wallet`, but `aster_configured` must be present and `true`.
5. **Never hardcode or guess wallet addresses.** They are unique per user and must come from `/user-details`.
6. **For opening a position:** Fetch current market context first (via `/api/lazy-trading/research`, `/api/lazy-trading/indian-stocks`, `/market-data`, or `/price` as appropriate), present it to the user, get explicit confirmation plus trade parameters (collateral, leverage, side, TP, SL), then execute.
   - **Market format rule (Ostium):** `/symbols` returns pairs like `ETH/USD`, but `/open-position` expects `market` as base token only (e.g. `ETH`). Convert by taking the base token before `/`.
7. **For setting TP/SL after opening:** Use the `actualTradeIndex` from the `/open-position` response. If you don't have it (e.g., position was opened earlier), call `/positions` to get `tradeIndex`, `pairIndex`, and `entryPrice`.
8. **For closing a position:** You need the `tradeIndex` — always call `/positions` first to look up the correct one for the user's specified market/position.
9. **Ask the user for trade parameters** — never assume collateral amount, leverage, TP%, or SL%. Present defaults but let the user confirm or override.
10. **Validate the market exists** by calling `/symbols` before trading if you're unsure whether a token is available on Ostium.
11. **For Alpha consumer flow:** Follow the exact order: `/alpha/agents` → `/alpha/listings` → `/alpha/purchase` (402) → `/alpha/pay` → `/alpha/purchase` (with `X-Payment`) → `/alpha/verify` → `/user-details` → `/alpha/execute`. Never skip steps. For `/alpha/verify`, pass the `content` object **exactly** as received from purchase — do not modify keys or values.

### Pre-Flight Checklist (Run Mentally Before Every API Call)

```
✅ Do I have the user's wallet address? → If not, call /user-details
✅ Does this flow require an agent address? → If yes, call /user-details and verify ostium_agent_address is present
✅ Does this endpoint need a tradeIndex? → If not in hand, call /positions
✅ Does this endpoint need entryPrice/pairIndex? → If not in hand, call /positions
✅ Did I ask the user for all trade parameters? → collateral, leverage, side, TP%, SL%
✅ Is the market/symbol valid? → If unsure, call /symbols to verify
✅ (Alpha) Do I have commitment? → If not, call /alpha/agents
✅ (Alpha) Do I have listingId? → If not, call /alpha/listings
✅ (Alpha) For /verify: Am I passing content exactly as received? → No modifications
✅ (Alpha) For /execute: Do I have agentAddress + userAddress? → Call /user-details
```

## Authentication

All requests require an API key with prefix `lt_`. Pass it via:
- Header: `X-API-KEY: lt_your_api_key`
- Or: `Authorization: Bearer lt_your_api_key`

## Market Research Workflow

When the user asks for market research, use the Maxxit market research endpoint instead of writing the research from scratch.

Endpoint:
- `POST /api/lazy-trading/research`
- `POST /api/lazy-trading/indian-stocks` for Indian equities research queries

Rules:
- Construct the `content` prompt from the user's ask.
- Preserve the user's asset, timeframe, strategy, and risk focus.
- If the user is vague, build a best-effort trading research query from the context they gave instead of inventing a different objective.
- Prefer prompts that ask for market structure, trend, momentum, support/resistance, catalysts, and trading risks when relevant.
- Set `deepResearch` to `true` when the user asks for deep research, a comprehensive comparison, a detailed diligence-style breakdown, or explicitly wants more thorough research.
- Set `deepResearch` to `false` for standard market summaries, quick trade briefs, or normal tactical research requests.
- For `POST /api/lazy-trading/indian-stocks`, OpenClaw must decide the request options from the user's query and should not ask the user to choose `chat_model`, `response_length`, or `thinking_level`.
- Always send `question` plus the inferred request options:
  - `chat_model`: `analytical` or `strategic`
  - `response_length`: `short`, `medium`, or `long`
  - `thinking_level`: only include this when `chat_model` is `strategic`
- Use `chat_model: "strategic"` when the user wants a trading plan, swing-trade setups, long/short ideas, entry zones, stop loss, target levels, timing for this week, or tactical positioning. In strategic mode, include `thinking_level` automatically:
  - use `balanced` by default
  - use `low` for quick, lightweight tactical asks
  - use `deep` only when the user explicitly asks for a more thoughtful or more detailed strategy answer
- Use `chat_model: "analytical"` for screens, rankings, fundamentals, valuation, sector comparisons, capex-cycle beneficiaries, earnings quality, balance sheet analysis, and diligence-style research. Do not send `thinking_level` in analytical mode.
- Infer `response_length` from the user’s ask:
  - use `short` for quick answers, concise trade ideas, and direct setup requests
  - use `medium` by default for normal research requests
  - use `long` for ranked lists, detailed comparisons, deep dives, or multi-factor explanations
- If the user’s wording contains both analytical and tactical elements, prioritize the main deliverable. If the answer must provide actionable trade setups, choose `strategic`; if the answer is mainly screening, ranking, valuation, or fundamental comparison, choose `analytical`.
- Summarize the response and format it for readability.

Prompt construction examples:
- User: "Research BTC for a swing long."
  - Query: `Analyze BTC for a swing-long setup. Cover market structure, momentum, key support/resistance, likely catalysts, invalidation levels, and major trading risks.`
- User: "Give me market research on ETH for today."
  - Query: `Summarize ETH market structure for today, including trend, momentum, key support/resistance, important catalysts, and trading risks for intraday positioning.`
- User: "Research SOL before I short it."
  - Query: `Analyze SOL for a potential short setup. Cover current market structure, weakness signals, resistance levels, downside levels to watch, catalysts, and key squeeze/invalidation risks.`

Example call:

```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/research" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "content": "Analyze BTC for a swing-long setup. Cover market structure, momentum, key support/resistance, likely catalysts, invalidation levels, and major trading risks.",
    "deepResearch": false
  }'
```

Indian stocks example:

```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/indian-stocks" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "question": "Screen for Indian IT stocks with strong profit growth and low debt.",
    "chat_model": "analytical",
    "response_length": "medium"
  }'
```

Indian stocks tactical example:

```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/indian-stocks" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "question": "Which Indian banking stocks look strongest for a swing trade this week? Give long ideas only, with entry zone, stop loss, target range, and the reasoning behind each setup.",
    "chat_model": "strategic",
    "response_length": "short",
    "thinking_level": "balanced"
  }'
```

When discussing Indian equities, NSE/BSE orders, holdings, targets, stop losses, or portfolio values:
- use **Indian rupees** as the default unit
- prefer `₹` in user-facing responses (for example, `₹2,450`, `₹1.2 lakh`)

## API Endpoints

## Ostium Programmatic Endpoints (`/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/*`)

> All endpoints under `/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/*` are for **Ostium** unless explicitly prefixed with `/aster/`.

### Get User Details

Retrieve lazy trading user information including wallet identity, agent status, Telegram connection, and trading preferences.

```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/user-details" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user_wallet": "0x...",
  "lazy_trading_ready": true,
  "agent": {
    "id": "agent-uuid",
    "name": "Lazy Trader - Username",
    "venue": "ostium",
    "status": "active"
  },
  "telegram_user": {
    "id": 123,
    "telegram_user_id": "123456789",
    "telegram_username": "trader"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "id": "deployment-uuid",
    "status": "active",
    "enabled_venues": ["ostium"]
  },
  "trading_preferences": {
    "risk_tolerance": "medium",
    "trade_frequency": "moderate"
  },
  "ostium_agent_address": "0x...",
  "aster_configured": true
}
```

If the user has not set up a lazy-trading agent yet, `/user-details` still returns `200` and identity data, for example:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user_wallet": "0x..."
}
```

### Get Available Symbols

Retrieve all available trading symbols from the Ostium exchange. Use this to discover which symbols you can trade.

```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/symbols" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "symbols": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "symbol": "BTC/USD",
      "group": "crypto",
      "maxLeverage": 150
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "symbol": "ETH/USD",
      "group": "crypto",
      "maxLeverage": 100
    }
  ],
  "groupedSymbols": {
    "crypto": [
      { "id": 0, "symbol": "BTC/USD", "group": "crypto", "maxLeverage": 150 },
      { "id": 1, "symbol": "ETH/USD", "group": "crypto", "maxLeverage": 100 }
    ],
    "forex": [...]
  },
  "count": 45
}
```

### Get Account Balance

Retrieve USDC and ETH balance for the user's Ostium wallet address.

> **⚠️ Dependency**: The `address` field is the user's Ostium wallet address (`user_wallet`). You MUST fetch it from `/user-details` first — do NOT hardcode or assume any address.

```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/balance" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{"address": "0x..."}"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "address": "0x...",
  "usdcBalance": "1000.50",
  "ethBalance": "0.045"
}
```

### Get Portfolio Positions

Get all open positions for the user's Ostium trading account. **This endpoint is critical** — it returns `tradeIndex`, `pairIndex`, and `entryPrice` which are required for closing positions and setting TP/SL.

> **⚠️ Dependency**: The `address` field must come from `/user-details` → `user_wallet`. NEVER guess it.
>
> **🔑 This endpoint provides values needed by**: `/close-position` (needs `tradeIndex`), `/set-take-profit` (needs `tradeIndex`, `pairIndex`, `entryPrice`), `/set-stop-loss` (needs `tradeIndex`, `pairIndex`, `entryPrice`).

```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/positions" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{"address": "0x..."}"
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "address": "0x..."  // REQUIRED — from /user-details → user_wallet. NEVER guess this.
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "positions": [
    {
      "market": "BTC",
      "marketFull": "BTC/USD",
      "side": "long",
      "collateral": 100.0,
      "entryPrice": 95000.0,
      "leverage": 10.0,
      "tradeId": "12345",
      "tradeIndex": 2,
      "pairIndex": "0",
      "notionalUsd": 1000.0,
      "totalFees": 2.50,
      "stopLossPrice": 85500.0,
      "takeProfitPrice": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "totalPositions": 1
}
```

> **Key fields to extract from each position:**
> - `tradeIndex` — needed for `/close-position`, `/set-take-profit`, `/set-stop-loss`
> - `pairIndex` — needed for `/set-take-profit`, `/set-stop-loss`
> - `entryPrice` — needed for `/set-take-profit`, `/set-stop-loss`
> - `side` — needed for `/set-take-profit`, `/set-stop-loss`
```

### Get Position History

Get trading history for a wallet.  
- `venue: "OSTIUM"` (default): uses Ostium history.
- `venue: "AVANTIS"`: returns normalized closed-trade history from Avantis `v2/history/portfolio/history`.

**Note:** The user's Ostium wallet address can be fetched from the `/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/user-details` endpoint (see Get Account Balance section above).

```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/history" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"venue":"OSTIUM","address":"0x...","count":50}'
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "venue": "OSTIUM",    // Optional: "OSTIUM" (default) or "AVANTIS"
  "address": "0x...",   // Required for OSTIUM; also accepted for AVANTIS as alias of userAddress
  "count": 50           // Number of recent orders to retrieve (default: 50)
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "history": [
    {
      "market": "ETH",
      "side": "long",
      "collateral": 50.0,
      "leverage": 5,
      "price": 3200.0,
      "pnlUsdc": 15.50,
      "profitPercent": 31.0,
      "totalProfitPercent": 31.0,
      "rolloverFee": 0.05,
      "fundingFee": 0.10,
      "executedAt": "2025-02-10T15:30:00Z",
      "tradeId": "trade_123"
    }
  ],
  "count": 25,
  "venue": "OSTIUM"
}
```

**Avantis history example (same `/history` endpoint):**
```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/history" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"venue":"AVANTIS","userAddress":"0x...","count":50}'
```

Returns normalized records like:
`id`, `tradeId` (`<pairIndex>:<tradeIndex>`), `market`, `side`, `collateralUsdc`, `positionSizeUsdc`, `leverage`, `entryPrice`, `closePrice`, `usdcSentToTrader`, `grossPnlUsdc`, `closedAt`, `timestamp`.

### Open Position

Open a new perpetual futures position on Ostium.

> **⚠️ Dependencies — ALL must be resolved BEFORE calling this endpoint:**
> 1. `agentAddress` → from `/user-details` → `ostium_agent_address` (NEVER guess)
> 2. `userAddress` → from `/user-details` → `user_wallet` (NEVER guess)
> 3. `market` → validate via `/symbols` endpoint if unsure the token exists
>    - If `/symbols` returns `ETH/USD`, pass `market: "ETH"` to `/open-position` (not `ETH/USD`)
> 4. `side`, `collateral`, `leverage` → **ASK the user explicitly**, do not assume
>
> **📊 Recommended Pre-Trade Flow:**
> 1. Call `/api/lazy-trading/research` for crypto trade research, or `/market-data` / `/price` for current market conditions
> 2. Present the market context to the user (price, structure, momentum, volatility when available)
> 3. Ask the user: "Do you want to proceed? Specify: collateral (USDC), leverage, long/short"
> 4. Only after user confirms → call `/open-position`
>
> **🔐 Verification Note:** Every trade is analyzed by EigenAI for alignment with market conditions. Users can verify the cryptographic signatures and reasoning for all their trades at [maxxit.ai/openclaw](https://www.maxxit.ai/openclaw).
>
> **🔑 SAVE the response** — `actualTradeIndex` and `entryPrice` are needed for setting TP/SL later.

  "isMarketOpen": true,
  "isDayTradingClosed": false
}
```

### Discover Traders to Copy (Copy Trading — Step 1)

Discover other OpenClaw Traders and top-performing traders to potentially copy-trade. This is the **first step** in the copy-trading workflow — the returned wallet addresses are used as the `address` parameter in the `/copy-trader-trades` endpoint.

> **⚠️ Dependency Chain**: This endpoint provides the wallet addresses needed by `/copy-trader-trades`. You MUST call this endpoint FIRST to get trader addresses — do NOT guess or hardcode addresses.
>
> **🚫 Self-copy guard**: Never use your own `user_wallet` from `/user-details` as a copy-trader address.

```bash
# Get all traders (OpenClaw + Leaderboard)
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/copy-traders" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"

# Get only OpenClaw Traders (prioritized)
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/copy-traders?source=openclaw" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"

# Get only Leaderboard traders with filters
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/copy-traders?source=leaderboard&minImpactFactor=50&minTrades=100" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `source` | string | `all` | `openclaw` (OpenClaw agents only), `leaderboard` (top traders only), `all` (both) |
| `limit` | int | 20 | Max results per tier (max 100) |
| `minTrades` | int | — | Min trade count filter (leaderboard only) |
| `minImpactFactor` | float | — | Min impact factor filter (leaderboard only) |

**Response:**

    }
  ],
  "openclawCount": 5,
  "topTradersCount": 20
}
```

**Key fields to use in next steps:**
- `openclawTraders[].creatorWallet` → use as `address` in `/copy-trader-trades`
- `topTraders[].walletAddress` → use as `address` in `/copy-trader-trades`
- Exclude any address equal to your own `/user-details.user_wallet`

### Get Trader's Recent Trades (Copy Trading — Step 2)

Fetch recent on-chain trades for a specific trader address. This queries the Ostium subgraph in real-time for fresh trade data.

> **⚠️ Dependency**: The `address` parameter MUST come from the `/copy-traders` endpoint response:
> - For OpenClaw traders: use `creatorWallet` from `openclawTraders[]`
> - For leaderboard traders: use `walletAddress` from `topTraders[]`
>
> **NEVER guess or hardcode the address.** Always call `/copy-traders` first.

```bash
# Step 1: Discover traders first
TRADER_ADDRESS=$(curl -s -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/copy-traders?source=openclaw" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" | jq -r '.openclawTraders[0].creatorWallet')

# Step 2: Fetch their recent trades
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/copy-trader-trades?address=${TRADER_ADDRESS}" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"

# With custom lookback and limit
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/copy-trader-trades?address=${TRADER_ADDRESS}&hours=48&limit=50" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `address` | string | *required* | Trader wallet address (from `/copy-traders`) |
| `limit` | int | 20 | Max trades to return (max 50) |
| `hours` | int | 24 | Lookback window in hours (max 168 / 7 days) |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "traderAddress": "0x4e7f1e29d9e1f81c3e9249e3444843c2006f3325",
  "trades": [
    {
      "tradeId": "0x123...",
      "side": "LONG",
      "tokenSymbol": "BTC",
      "pair": "BTC/USD",
      "collateral": 500.00,
      "leverage": 10.0,
      "entryPrice": 95000.50,
      "takeProfitPrice": 100000.00,
      "stopLossPrice": 90000.00,
      "timestamp": "2026-02-17T14:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 5,
  "lookbackHours": 24
}
```

**Trade Field Descriptions:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `side` | `"LONG"` or `"SHORT"` — the trade direction |
| `tokenSymbol` | Token being traded (e.g., `BTC`, `ETH`) |
| `pair` | Full pair label (e.g., `BTC/USD`) |
| `collateral` | USDC amount used as collateral |
| `leverage` | Leverage multiplier (e.g., 10.0 = 10x) |
| `entryPrice` | Price at which the trade was opened |
| `takeProfitPrice` | Take profit price (null if not set) |
| `stopLossPrice` | Stop loss price (null if not set) |
| `timestamp` | When the trade was opened |

> **Next step**: After reviewing the trades, use `/open-position` to open a similar position. You'll need your own `agentAddress` and `userAddress` from `/user-details`.

## Signal Format Examples

The lazy trading system processes natural language trading signals. Here are examples:

### Opening Positions
- `"Long ETH with 5x leverage, entry at 3200"`
- `"Short BTC 10x, TP 60000, SL 68000"`
- `"Buy 100 USDC worth of ETH perpetual"`

### With Risk Management
- `"Long SOL 3x leverage, entry 150, take profit 180, stop loss 140"`
- `"Short AVAX 5x, risk 2% of portfolio"`

### Closing Positions
- `"Close ETH long position"`
- `"Take profit on BTC short"`

## Complete Workflow Examples

These are the mandatory step-by-step workflows for common trading operations. **Follow these exactly.**

### Workflow 1: Opening a New Position (Full Flow)

```
Step 1: GET /user-details
   → Extract: user_wallet (→ userAddress), ostium_agent_address (→ agentAddress)
   → Cache these for the session

Step 2: GET /symbols
   → Verify the user's requested token is available on Ostium
   → Extract exact symbol string and maxLeverage
   → Convert pair format to market token for /open-position:
     "ETH/USD" -> "ETH"

Step 3: POST /api/lazy-trading/research  (or GET /market-data or GET /price for current context)
   → Get trade context: market structure, momentum, support/resistance, catalysts, and current price
   → Present this data to the user:
     "BTC is trading around $95,000 with bullish structure and clear support/resistance levels.
      Do you want to proceed?"

Step 4: ASK the user for trade parameters
   → "Please confirm: collateral (USDC), leverage, long or short?"
   → "Would you like to set TP and SL? If so, what percentages?"
   → Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding

Step 5: POST /open-position
   → Use agentAddress and userAddress from Step 1
   → Use market, side, collateral, leverage from Step 4
   → IMPORTANT: Pass market as base token only (e.g. ETH), not pair format (ETH/USD)
   → SAVE the response: actualTradeIndex and entryPrice

Step 6 (if user wants TP/SL): POST /set-take-profit and/or POST /set-stop-loss
   → Use tradeIndex = actualTradeIndex from Step 5
   → Use entryPrice from Step 5
   → For pairIndex, use the symbol id from Step 2 or call /positions
   → Use takeProfitPercent/stopLossPercent from Step 4

Step 7: ASK — "Would you like to list this trade as alpha on the marketplace?"
   → If user says NO → Done.
   → If user says YES → Continue to Step 8.
   → Also ask: "What price in USDC would you like to charge?" (e.g. 5 USDC)

Step 8: POST /alpha/generate-proof
   → Body: { "tradeId": "{tradeId from Step 5}", "autoProcess": false }
   → tradeId comes from the /open-position response
   → autoProcess: false queues the proof for the worker (~3-5 min)
   → SAVE: proofId from the response

Step 9: Wait for proof verification
   → If autoProcess was true and response has status: "VERIFIED" → go to Step 10
   → If autoProcess was false or status is still PENDING/PROVING:
     Poll GET /alpha/proof-status?proofId={proofId} every 10 seconds
     → Wait until status === "VERIFIED"
     → If status === "FAILED" → inform the user and stop

Step 10: POST /alpha/flag
   → Body: {
       "proofId": "{proofId from Step 8}",
       "priceUsdc": {price from Step 7},
       "token": "{market from Step 5, e.g. ETH}",
       "side": "{side from Step 5, e.g. long}",
       "leverage": {leverage from Step 5}
     }
   → Show user the response: listingId, tradeId, proofMetrics
   → "Your trade is now listed as alpha! Listing ID: {listingId}"
```

### Workflow 2: Closing an Existing Position

```
Step 1: GET /user-details
   → Extract: user_wallet, ostium_agent_address

Step 2: POST /positions (address = user_wallet from Step 1)
   → List all open positions
   → Present them to the user if multiple: "You have 3 open positions: BTC long, ETH short, SOL long. Which one do you want to close?"
   → Extract the tradeIndex for the position to close

Step 3: POST /close-position
   → Use agentAddress and userAddress from Step 1
   → Use market and actualTradeIndex from Step 2
   → Show the user the closePnl from the response
```

### Workflow 3: Setting TP/SL on an Existing Position

```
Step 1: GET /user-details
   → Extract: user_wallet, ostium_agent_address

Step 2: POST /positions (address = user_wallet from Step 1)
   → Find the target position
   → Extract: tradeIndex, entryPrice, pairIndex, side

Step 3: ASK the user
   → "Position: BTC long at $95,000. Current TP: none, SL: $85,500."
   → "What TP% and SL% would you like to set?"

Step 4: POST /set-take-profit and/or POST /set-stop-loss
   → Use ALL values from Steps 1-3 — NEVER guess any of them
```

### Workflow 4: Checking Portfolio & Market Overview

```
Step 1: GET /user-details
   → Extract: user_wallet

Step 2: POST /balance (address = user_wallet)
   → Show the user their USDC and ETH balances

Step 3: POST /positions (address = user_wallet)
   → Show all open positions with PnL details

Step 4 (optional): GET /market-data
   → Show market conditions for tokens they hold
```

### Workflow 5: Copy-Trading Another OpenClaw Agent (Full Flow)

```
Step 1: GET /copy-traders?source=openclaw
   → Discover other OpenClaw Trader agents
   → Extract: creatorWallet from the trader you want to copy
   → Exclude your own wallet (`/user-details.user_wallet`) if it appears
   → IMPORTANT: This is a REQUIRED first step — you cannot call
     /copy-trader-trades without an address from this endpoint

Step 2: GET /copy-trader-trades?address={creatorWallet}
   → Fetch recent trades for that trader from the Ostium subgraph
   → Review: side (LONG/SHORT), tokenSymbol, leverage, collateral, entry price
   → Decide: "Should I copy this trade?"
   → DEPENDENCY: The address param comes from Step 1 (creatorWallet or walletAddress)

Step 3: GET /user-details
   → Get YOUR OWN userAddress (user_wallet) and agentAddress (ostium_agent_address)
   → These are needed to execute your own trade

Step 4: POST /open-position
   → Mirror the trade from Step 2 using your own addresses from Step 3:
     - market = tokenSymbol from the copied trade
     - side = side from the copied trade (LONG/SHORT → long/short)
     - collateral = decide based on your own risk tolerance
     - leverage = match the copied trader's leverage or adjust
   → SAVE: actualTradeIndex and entryPrice from response

Step 5 (optional): POST /set-take-profit and/or POST /set-stop-loss
   → Use actualTradeIndex and entryPrice from Step 4
   → Match the copied trader's TP/SL ratios or set your own
```

**Dependency Chain Summary:**
```
/copy-traders → provides address → /copy-trader-trades → provides trade details
/user-details → provides your addresses → /open-position → copies the trade
```

## Automated Trading Strategies

Maxxit provides specialized scripts for different market conditions. These scripts require dynamic parameters passed via command line.

### Execution Policy
- **Dynamic Arguments**: Scripts MUST be invoked with `--symbol` and `--venue`.
- **Agent Responsibility**: If the user asks to start a strategy but does not provide the symbol (e.g., "BTC/USD") or the venue (e.g., "AVANTIS"), the agent MUST ask the user for the missing information before executing the script.
- **Example Command**: `python taker-strategy.py --symbol BTC/USD --venue AVANTIS`

### 1. Aggressive Taker (HFT / Order Flow)
- **Script**: `taker-strategy.py`
- **Usage**: `python taker-strategy.py --symbol <SYMBOL> --venue <VENUE>`
- **Logic Summary**: Monitors the "Taker Buy Ratio" on Binance. When aggressive buyers (takers) dominate sellers beyond a threshold (0.60), it signals a high-conviction momentum move.
- **Best For**: Capturing rapid price changes in high-volume environments (Active Scalping).

### 2. Mean Reversion (Sideways / Range)
- **Script**: `mean-reversion-strategy.py`
- **Usage**: `python mean-reversion-strategy.py --symbol <SYMBOL> --venue <VENUE>`
- **Logic Summary**: Combines RSI (extreme oversold/overbought) with Bollinger Band touches. It identifies "exhaustion" points where the price is likely to bounce back to the average.
- **Best For**: Range-bound or sideways markets where there is no clear trend.

### 3. Volatility Breakout (Momentum)
- **Script**: `breakout-strategy.py`
- **Usage**: `python breakout-strategy.py --symbol <SYMBOL> --venue <VENUE>`
- **Logic Summary**: Enters a trade only when price breaks out of a standard deviation channel (Bollinger Bands) *and* volatility (ATR) is increasing. This filters out "fake" breakouts.
- **Best For**: Catching the start of a strong trend after a period of consolidation.

### 4. VWAP Crossover (Institutional Momentum)
- **Script**: `vwap-strategy.py`
- **Usage**: `python vwap-strategy.py --symbol <SYMBOL> --venue <VENUE>`
- **Logic Summary**: Uses Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) combined with a 20 EMA. A "Long" is triggered when price is above both the VWAP and the EMA, signaling that both volume and time-weighted momentum are positive.
- **Best For**: Intraday momentum trading and confirming trend strength with volume.

## Aster DEX (BNB Chain) Endpoints

> Aster DEX is a perpetual futures exchange on BNB Chain. Use Aster endpoints when the user wants to trade on BNB Chain. The Aster API uses **API Key + Secret** authentication (stored server-side) — you do NOT need `agentAddress`. You only need `userAddress` from `/user-details`.

### Venue Selection

| Venue | Chain | Symbol Format | Auth Required | When to Use |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Ostium** | Arbitrum (mainnet by default, testnet on explicit request) | `BTC`, `ETH` | `agentAddress` + `userAddress` | Default for most trades |
| **Aster** | BNB Chain (testnet only) | `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT` | `userAddress` only | When user specifies BNB Chain or Aster |
| **Avantis** | Base (mainnet only) | Base token for orders (e.g. `BTC`), pair format in symbols/positions (e.g. `BTC/USD`) | `agentAddress` + `userAddress` | When user specifies Base chain or Avantis |

> **Network behavior rule:** Do not ask users to choose mainnet/testnet for these venues by default. Ostium uses mainnet unless the user explicitly asks for testnet / Arbitrum Sepolia. Aster is fixed to testnet, and Avantis is fixed to Base mainnet.

**How to check if Aster is configured:** In the `/user-details` response, `aster_configured: true` means the user has set up Aster API keys. If `false`, direct them to set up Aster at maxxit.ai/openclaw.

### Aster Symbols

Aster uses Binance-style symbol format: `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, etc. The API auto-appends `USDT` if you pass just `BTC`.

> Use this endpoint when users ask for "all old trades/orders", "order history", or "past orders" on Aster.

### Aster Open Position

> **📋 LLM Pre-Call Checklist — Ask the user these questions before calling this endpoint:**
> 1. **Symbol**: "Which token do you want to trade?" (e.g. BTC, ETH, SOL)
> 2. **Side**: "Long or short?"
> 3. **Quantity**: "How much [TOKEN] do you want to trade?" — get the answer in base asset units (e.g. `0.01 BTC`, `0.5 ETH`).
> 4. **Leverage**: "What leverage? (e.g. 10x)"
> 5. **Order type**: "Market order or limit order?" (default: MARKET). If LIMIT, also ask for the limit price.
>
> **Aster requires `quantity` (base asset) for open-position. Do not use collateral.**
> **NEVER call this endpoint without a confirmed `quantity` in base asset units.**

### Aster Parameter Dependency Graph

| Parameter | Source | How to Get |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `userAddress` | `/user-details` → `user_wallet` | `GET /user-details` |
| `aster_configured` | `/user-details` → `aster_configured` | `GET /user-details` (must be `true`) |
| `symbol` | User specifies token | User input (auto-resolved: `BTC` → `BTCUSDT`) |
| `side` | User specifies `"long"` or `"short"` | User input (required) |
| `quantity` | User specifies in base asset units (e.g. `0.01 BTC`) | User input (required). If user provides USDT/collateral amount, ask for quantity instead. Do not calculate in the workflow. |
| `leverage` | User specifies | User input |
| `entryPrice` | `/aster/positions` → `entryPrice` | From position data |
| `stopPrice` | User specifies or calculated from percent | User input or calculated |

### Aster Workflow: Open Position on BNB Chain

```
Step 1: GET /user-details
   → Extract: user_wallet
   → Check: aster_configured == true (if false, tell user to set up Aster at maxxit.ai/openclaw)

Step 2: GET /aster/symbols
   → Verify the token is available on Aster

Step 3: GET /aster/price?token=BTC
   → Get current price, present to user

Step 4: ASK the user for ALL trade parameters
   → "Which token?" (e.g. BTC, ETH, SOL)
   → "Long or short?"
   → "How much [TOKEN] do you want to buy/sell?" — collect answer in BASE asset units (e.g. 0.01 BTC)
       • If user gives a USDT/collateral amount, ask them to provide token quantity instead.
   → "Leverage? (e.g. 10x)"
   → "Market or limit order?" — if LIMIT, also ask for the limit price

Step 5: POST /aster/open-position
   → Use userAddress from Step 1
   → Use symbol, side, quantity (base asset), leverage from Step 4
   → SAVE orderId and avgPrice from response

Step 6 (if user wants TP/SL): POST /aster/set-take-profit and/or POST /aster/set-stop-loss
   → Use entryPrice = avgPrice from Step 5
   → Use side from Step 4
   → Ask user for takeProfitPercent / stopLossPercent (or exact stopPrice)
```

### Aster Workflow: Close Position

```
Step 1: GET /user-details → Extract user_wallet

Step 2: POST /aster/positions (userAddress = user_wallet)
   → Show positions to user, let them pick which to close

Step 3: POST /aster/close-position
   → Pass userAddress and symbol
   → Omit quantity to close full position
```

## Avantis DEX (Base Chain) Endpoints

> Avantis DEX is a perpetual futures exchange on Base chain. Use Avantis endpoints when the user wants to trade on Base. Avantis uses **delegation-based auth** (same pattern as Ostium) — you need both `agentAddress` and `userAddress` from `/user-details`.

**How to check if Avantis is configured:** Use `/user-details` and check `deployment.enabled_venues`. If it includes `"AVANTIS"`, Avantis is enabled for the current deployment. If not, direct the user to enable Avantis at maxxit.ai/openclaw.

### Avantis Symbols

Avantis symbols are returned in pair format (e.g. `BTC/USD`, `ETH/USD`). The API endpoint maps the service's `/markets` route.

```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/avantis/symbols" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "markets": [
    {
      "pairIndex": 0,
      "symbol": "BTC/USD",
      "group": "crypto"
    },
    {
      "pairIndex": 1,
      "symbol": "ETH/USD",
      "group": "crypto"
    }
  ],
  "count": 50
}
```

### Avantis Workflow: Open Position on Base Chain

```
Step 1: GET /user-details
   → Extract: user_wallet, ostium_agent_address (shared agent wallet)
   → Check: deployment.enabled_venues includes AVANTIS (if not, tell user to enable Avantis at maxxit.ai/openclaw)

Step 2: GET /avantis/symbols
   → Verify the token is available on Avantis

Step 3: ASK the user for ALL trade parameters
   → "Which token?" (e.g. BTC, ETH)
   → "Long or short?"
   → "How much USDC collateral?"
   → "Leverage? (e.g. 10x)"
   → "Would you like to set TP/SL? If so, what percentages?"

Step 4: POST /avantis/open-position
   → Use agentAddress and userAddress from Step 1
   → Use market, side, collateral, leverage from Step 3
   → SAVE: tradeIndex and entryPrice from response
```

### Avantis Workflow: Close Position

```
Step 1: GET /user-details → Extract user_wallet, ostium_agent_address (shared agent wallet)

Step 2: POST /avantis/positions (userAddress + agentAddress)
   → Show positions to user, let them pick which to close
   → Extract tradeIndex

Step 3: POST /avantis/close-position
   → Pass agentAddress, userAddress, market
   → Optionally pass actualTradeIndex
```

## Zerodha (Indian Stocks) Endpoints

> Zerodha is an Indian stock broker supporting equities on NSE and BSE. Use Zerodha endpoints when the user wants to trade Indian stocks, mentions NSE/BSE, or says "Indian stocks", "equities", or "Zerodha".

### When to Use Zerodha

- User wants to trade Indian stocks on NSE or BSE
- User mentions "Indian stocks", "equities", "NSE", "BSE", "Zerodha", or "Kite"
- User asks about their Zerodha portfolio, holdings, or positions
- User wants to place, modify, or cancel orders on Indian exchanges
- User wants to fetch instrument lists or market data for Indian equities

### Currency Convention

- In Indian-market conversations, present prices, holdings, portfolio values, targets, and stop losses in **₹**
- Prefer `₹` in normal user-facing replies
- Do not default to USD when the context is Zerodha, NSE, BSE, or Indian equities

### Venue Routing

| Keywords | Route |
|----------|-------|
| "Indian stocks", "NSE", "BSE", "equities", "Zerodha", "Kite" | Zerodha endpoints |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `KITE_API_KEY` | Zerodha Kite Connect API key | SSM (set in OpenClaw UI) |
| `KITE_API_SECRET` | Zerodha Kite Connect API secret | SSM (set in OpenClaw UI) |
| `KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Short-lived access token (expires daily) | SSM (auto-stored after OAuth) |
| `KITE_USER_NAME` | Zerodha display name for status/UI | SSM (auto-stored after OAuth) |

### Auth Pre-Flight

Before any Zerodha trading call, check session validity:

```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/zerodha/session" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "X-KITE-API-KEY: ${KITE_API_KEY}" \
  -H "X-KITE-ACCESS-TOKEN: ${KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

If `authenticated: false` or `expired: true`, tell the user:
> "Your Zerodha session has expired. Please re-authenticate on the OpenClaw page at maxxit.ai/openclaw."

**Important**: All Zerodha requests must include:
- `X-API-KEY` header (normal Maxxit auth)
- `X-KITE-API-KEY` header
- `X-KITE-ACCESS-TOKEN` header
- For wallet identity, call `/user-details` first and use `user_wallet`. Zerodha does **not** require `ostium_agent_address` or `lazy_trading_ready: true`.

### Zerodha Endpoints

All base path: `${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/zerodha/`

#### GET /zerodha/login

Generate a Zerodha login URL for the user.

Important:
- Do not tell the user to open a bare Kite URL like `https://kite.zerodha.com/connect/login?api_key=...&v=3`.
- The login flow must preserve the Maxxit user context so the callback can store the Zerodha session against the correct wallet.
- When the user asks for the login link, give them the `login_url` exactly as returned by the Maxxit API. That URL may use the Kite domain, but it must include the Maxxit user handoff in `redirect_params`.
- Preferred flow:
  1. Call `GET /user-details` to resolve `user_wallet`.
  2. Call `GET /zerodha/login` with `X-API-KEY`.
  3. Send the returned `login_url` to the user.
- Do **not** manually construct a `?userWallet=<wallet>&redirect=1` URL in the normal skill flow.
- If you present the returned `login_url`, only use it if it includes the user handoff, e.g. `redirect_params=userWallet%3D...`.

```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/zerodha/login" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "login_url": "https://kite.zerodha.com/connect/login?api_key=5wh5hi6ky7y8s6g4&v=3&redirect_params=userWallet%3D0x796a837c78326ba693847deebd7811d6b6854c56",
  "message": "Open the login_url in your browser to authenticate with Zerodha."
}
```

#### GET /zerodha/session

Check Zerodha session status. Returns `authenticated: true` if session is valid.

```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/zerodha/session" \

  -H "X-KITE-API-KEY: ${KITE_API_KEY}" \
  -H "X-KITE-ACCESS-TOKEN: ${KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

#### DELETE /zerodha/session

Trustless ZK-verified trading signals. **Producers** generate proofs and flag positions as alpha; **consumers** discover agents by commitment, purchase alpha via x402, verify content, and execute.

**Base path:** `${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/alpha/*`  
**Auth:** `X-API-KEY` header (same as other endpoints).  
**Payment:** On-chain USDC on Arbitrum Sepolia (testnet) or Arbitrum One (mainnet).

**Prerequisites for consuming alpha:**
- User must have completed Lazy Trading setup (agent deployed) — `/user-details` must return `ostium_agent_address`. The `/pay` endpoint uses this agent to send USDC; without it, `/pay` returns 400.
- Agent wallet must hold enough USDC for the listing price. If insufficient, `/pay` returns 402 with `required` and `available` amounts — inform the user to fund the agent address.

### Alpha Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/alpha/agents` | GET | Discover agents with verified metrics (commitment, winRate, totalPnl). Query: `minWinRate`, `minTrades`, `limit`. |
| `/alpha/listings` | GET | Browse active alpha listings (metadata + price, no trade content). Query: `commitment`, `maxPrice`, `limit`. |
| `/alpha/purchase/:listingId` | GET | **Phase 1** (no `X-Payment` header): returns 402 + payment details. **Phase 2** (with `X-Payment: txHash`): verifies on-chain, returns alpha. |
| `/alpha/pay/:listingId` | POST | **Payment helper**: sends USDC from your agent on-chain. Returns `txHash`. Call between Phase 1 and Phase 2. |
| `/alpha/verify` | POST | Body: `{ listingId, content }`. Verify purchased content hash matches commitment. |
| `/alpha/execute` | POST | Body: `{ alphaContent, agentAddress, userAddress, collateral, leverageOverride? }`. Execute alpha trade on the venue from `alphaContent.venue` (`OSTIUM` or `AVANTIS`). |
| `/alpha/generate-proof` | POST | (Producer) Generate ZK proof of trading performance. Body: `{ venue?: \"OSTIUM\" | \"AVANTIS\", tradeId?: string, autoProcess?: boolean }`. Pass `tradeId` to feature a specific trade; omit for most recent open trade. `autoProcess: false` is processed by the worker (~3-5 min). |
| `/alpha/proof-status` | GET | (Producer) Check proof processing status. Query: `proofId`. |
| `/alpha/my-proof` | GET | (Producer) Latest proof status and metrics. |
| `/alpha/flag` | POST | (Producer) Body: `{ proofId, priceUsdc, token, side, leverage? }`. List verified trade as alpha using the proof ID from generate-proof. |

**Venue/trade reference notes:**
- `tradeId` for `venue: "OSTIUM"` should be the trade index (example: `"123"`).
- For `venue: "AVANTIS"`, use tradeId from `/avantis/positions`: `"<pairIndex>:<tradeIndex>"` (example: `"1:0"`).
- Internally, proofs/listings are stored as a prefixed trade reference: `<VENUE>:<ID>` (for example, `OSTIUM:123`, `AVANTIS:1:0`).

### How x402 Purchase Works (3 API Calls)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: To purchase alpha content you MUST call these 3 endpoints in this exact order. Do NOT skip steps. The `/pay` endpoint handles all wallet operations server-side — you do NOT need a private key.

```
Step A:  GET  /alpha/purchase/{listingId}              → 402 + paymentDetails
Step B:  POST /alpha/pay/{listingId}                   → { txHash }
Step C:  GET  /alpha/purchase/{listingId}              → 200 + alpha content
         + Header: X-Payment: {txHash from Step B}
```

**Step A — Get payment details:**
```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/alpha/purchase/{listingId}" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```
Response: `402` with `paymentDetails.price`, `paymentDetails.payTo`, `paymentDetails.network`.  
If response is `200`: you already own this listing — alpha is returned directly, skip to Step 4.

**Step B — Send USDC (server handles everything):**
```bash
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/alpha/pay/{listingId}" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}"
```
Response: `200` with `txHash`, `from`, `to`, `amount`.  
If `alreadyPaid: true`: use the returned `txHash` directly.  
If `402`: insufficient USDC balance — response has `required` and `available` amounts.

**Step C — Retrieve alpha content:**
```bash
curl -L -X GET "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/alpha/purchase/{listingId}" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "X-Payment: {txHash from Step B}"
```
Response: `200` with `alpha` object (token, side, leverage, venue, entryPrice), `contentHash`, `payment` receipt.

**SAVE from Step C:** `alpha`, `contentHash`, `listingId` — needed for `/verify` and `/execute`.

**Pass `content` exactly as received:** For `/alpha/verify`, the `content` field must be the exact `alpha` object from Step C. Do not modify keys, values, or key order — the hash is computed using sorted keys and any change will cause verification to fail.

### Alpha Dependency Chain

```
/alpha/agents          → commitment
/alpha/listings        → listingId  (needs commitment)
/alpha/purchase        → 402 paymentDetails  (needs listingId)
/alpha/pay             → txHash  (needs listingId)
/alpha/purchase        → alpha content  (needs listingId + txHash in X-Payment header)
/alpha/verify          → verified  (needs listingId + alpha content)
/user-details          → agentAddress, userAddress
/alpha/execute         → trade result  (needs alpha + addresses + collateral)
```

### Workflow: Consuming Alpha (Complete Flow)

```
Step 1: GET /alpha/agents
   → Pick an agent by commitment, winRate, totalPnl
   → SAVE: commitment

Step 2: GET /alpha/listings?commitment={commitment}
   → Browse listings, pick one
   → SAVE: listingId

Step 3a: GET /alpha/purchase/{listingId}
   → If 200: already purchased, skip to Step 4
   → If 402: need to pay → go to Step 3b

Step 3b: POST /alpha/pay/{listingId}
   → Server sends USDC from your agent to the producer
   → If 402: insufficient USDC balance → fund your agent wallet and retry
   → If alreadyPaid: use the returned txHash
   → SAVE: txHash

Step 3c: GET /alpha/purchase/{listingId}
   → Header: X-Payment: {txHash from Step 3b}
   → SAVE: alpha, contentHash, listingId

Step 4: POST /alpha/verify
   → Body: { "listingId": "...", "content": { ...alpha from Step 3c } }
   → Check: verified === true

Step 5: GET /user-details
   → Extract: user_wallet → userAddress
   → Extract: ostium_agent_address → agentAddress

Step 6: POST /alpha/execute
   → Body: { "alphaContent": { ...alpha }, "agentAddress": "...",
             "userAddress": "...", "collateral": 100 }
   → alphaContent must include at least token and side (from alpha)
   → agentAddress = ostium_agent_address, userAddress = user_wallet (both from /user-details)
   → collateral: ask user or use default (e.g. 100 USDC)
   → Check: success === true
```

### Workflow: Producing Alpha

> **⚠️ This is the standalone producer workflow.** If the user just opened a position via Workflow 1, Steps 7-10 already handle alpha listing — you don't need to repeat this. Use this workflow only when the user wants to list an existing open position.

```
Step 1: POST /positions (address = user_wallet from /user-details)
   → List open positions
   → Let user pick which trade to feature
   → SAVE: tradeId, market (token), side, leverage from the chosen position

Step 2: POST /alpha/generate-proof
   → Body: { "venue": "OSTIUM", "tradeId": "{tradeId from Step 1}", "autoProcess": true }
   → SAVE: proofId from response
   → If status is already VERIFIED → go to Step 4

Step 3: Poll GET /alpha/proof-status?proofId={proofId}
   → Wait until status === "VERIFIED"
   → Poll every 10 seconds (max ~5 min)
   → If FAILED → inform user and stop

Step 4: ASK user for price
   → "What USDC price would you like to charge for this alpha?"

Step 5: POST /alpha/flag
   → Body: {
       "proofId": "{proofId from Step 2}",
       "priceUsdc": {price from Step 4},
       "token": "{market from Step 1}",
       "side": "{side from Step 1}",
       "leverage": {leverage from Step 1}
     }
   → Show user: listingId, proofMetrics (tradeCount, winRate, totalPnl)
   → "Your trade is listed as alpha! Listing ID: {listingId}"
```

**Example curl commands:**
```bash
# Generate proof with specific tradeId
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/alpha/generate-proof" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"venue":"OSTIUM","tradeId":"1612509","autoProcess":false}'

# Check proof status
curl -G "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/alpha/proof-status" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  --data-urlencode "proofId=<proof_id>"

# Flag as alpha using proofId
curl -L -X POST "${MAXXIT_API_URL}/api/lazy-trading/programmatic/alpha/flag" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${MAXXIT_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"proofId": "<proof_id>", "priceUsdc": 5, "token": "ETH", "side": "long", "leverage": 6}'
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MAXXIT_API_KEY` | Your lazy trading API key (starts with `lt_`) | `lt_abc123...` |
| `MAXXIT_API_URL` | Maxxit API base URL | `https://maxxit.ai` |

## Error Handling

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 401 | Invalid or missing API key |
| 404 | Resource not found for the specific endpoint (not returned by `/user-details` just because an agent is missing) |
| 400 | Missing or invalid message / parameters |
| 405 | Wrong HTTP method |
| 500 | Server error |

**Alpha-specific errors:**
| 400 | `/pay`: No agent address found (user must complete Lazy Trading setup). `/purchase`: Invalid X-Payment header or payment verification failed. |
| 402 | Payment required (`/purchase` Phase 1) or insufficient USDC balance (`/pay` — check `required` and `available` in response). |
| 409 | Transaction hash already used (replay protection — each tx can only purchase one listing). |
| 410 | Alpha listing no longer active. |

## Getting Started

1. **Set up Lazy Trading**: Visit https://maxxit.ai/lazy-trading to connect your wallet and configure your agent
2. **Generate API Key**: Go to your dashboard and create an API key
3. **Configure Environment**: Set `MAXXIT_API_KEY` and `MAXXIT_API_URL`
4. **Start Trading**: Use this skill to send signals!

## Security Notes

- Never share your API key
- API keys can be revoked and regenerated from the dashboard
- All trades execute on-chain with your delegated wallet permissions
