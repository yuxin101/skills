- **Speech Recognition** - Calling ASR for speech recognition, converting to text, with particular attention to accurate recognition of numerical and precise information
- **Image Recognition** - Analyzing exercise images to recognize exercise types and estimate durations
- **Exercise Recognition** - Accurately recognizing exercise types in user descriptions or images
- **Entity Extraction** - Extracting key information such as exercise names, durations, and intensity levels
- **Duration Estimation** - Intelligently estimating exercise duration (minutes) based on descriptions or images
- **Calorie Expenditure Estimation** - Estimating calories consumed based on exercise type, duration, and intensity
- **Standardized Output** - Generating standardized format containing exercise information and calorie expenditure

## Exercise Duration Estimation Principles

### Estimation Methodology

When estimating exercise duration, intelligent evaluation should be based on the following principles:

1. **Based on Common Sense and Public Data**: Reference typical duration data from exercise fitness guidelines and industry standards, combined with exercise types for estimation.

2. **Consider Duration Description Semantics**: Accurately understand duration modifier words in user descriptions (e.g., "half an hour", "one hour", "20 minutes"), and judge actual duration based on context.

3. **Comprehensive Exercise Characteristics**: Consider factors affecting duration such as exercise type, intensity, and individual physical fitness. For example:
   - High-intensity exercises (e.g., HIIT) typically have shorter durations
   - Low-intensity exercises (e.g., walking) can last longer
   - Team sports (e.g., basketball, soccer) typically have fixed durations

4. **Prioritize Explicit Numerical Values**: If users provide specific durations (e.g., "30 minutes", "1 hour"), directly use that value.

5. **Image Recognition Duration Estimation**:
   - **Exercise Equipment Priority**: If the image contains exercise equipment (e.g., treadmills, elliptical trainers), prioritize using the duration number displayed on the equipment
   - **Exercise App Priority**: If the image contains exercise app screenshots, prioritize using the exercise duration displayed on the app
   - **Wearable Device Priority**: If the image contains smart wristbands, watches, or other devices, prioritize using the exercise duration displayed on the device

6. **Estimation Uncertainty**: For ambiguous descriptions, request clarification from users when necessary to ensure result accuracy and reliability.

### Estimation Accuracy Requirements

- Prioritize authoritative data sources
- For composite exercises (e.g., cross-training), decompose main exercise types and estimate separately
- Maintain consistency and interpretability of estimation logic
- All exercise duration estimation must be accurate and reliable

## Calorie Expenditure Estimation Principles

### Estimation Methodology

When estimating exercise calorie expenditure, intelligent evaluation should be based on the following principles:

1. **Reference Exercise Calorie Databases**: Based on standard data from authoritative exercise calorie databases, obtain calorie expenditure data (calories consumed per minute) for different exercise types at different intensity levels.

2. **Consider Exercise Intensity Impact**: Different exercise intensities affect calorie expenditure, for example:
   - Low intensity: slow walking, light yoga
   - Moderate intensity: normal speed running, swimming, cycling
   - High intensity: sprinting, HIIT, jumping rope

3. **Consider Individual Factors**: Individual weight, age, gender, and other factors affect calorie expenditure, using these user information for estimation.

4. **Duration × Intensity**: Calorie expenditure = exercise duration (minutes) × calories consumed per minute for that exercise at corresponding intensity.

5. **Mark Estimation Uncertainty**: Due to variations in individual physical conditions, exercise skills, etc., calorie expenditure estimation may have certain errors, which should be marked in output with estimation basis and confidence level.

6. **Accurate Exercise Data**: Utilize exercise search interface provided by API service to obtain accurate calorie expenditure information for all exercise types.
   - **Exercise Type Matching**: Based on user descriptions or image-recognized exercise types, find the most matching exercise in the exercise list.
   - **Intensity Judgment**: Judge exercise intensity (low, medium, high) based on user descriptions or exercise characteristics.
   - **Calorie Calculation**: Use matching exercise type and intensity to calculate calorie expenditure.

### Estimation Accuracy Requirements

- Prioritize median or average values from authoritative databases
- Consider common variation ranges of exercises
- For composite exercises, reference nutrition information of similar exercises
- Maintain consistency and interpretability of estimation logic
- All calorie expenditure data must be accurate and reliable
