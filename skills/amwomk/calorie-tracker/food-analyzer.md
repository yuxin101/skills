## Food Weight Estimation Principles

### Estimation Methodology

When estimating food weight, intelligent evaluation should be based on the following principles:

1. **Based on Common Sense and Public Data**: Reference typical portion data from food nutrition databases, dietary guidelines, and industry standards, combined with food physical characteristics for estimation.

2. **Consider Portion Description Semantics**: Accurately understand portion modifier words in user descriptions (e.g., "small bowl", "large portion", "small amount"), and judge actual portion size based on context.

3. **Comprehensive Food Characteristics**: Consider factors affecting weight such as food type, form, density, and water content. For example:
   - Liquid or semi-liquid foods (porridge, soup noodles) need to consider broth ratio
   - Foods with skin/bone/seed need to estimate edible portion ratio
   - Cooking methods affect food weight changes (e.g., frying increases weight, baking reduces water)

4. **Based on Edible Portion Estimation**: All weight estimation must be based on edible portion (net weight). For foods with skin, bones, seeds, or shells, non-edible parts must be removed for calculation, including but not limited to:
   - Fruits: peels (e.g., orange peel, banana peel), seeds (e.g., apple core, peach pit)
   - Meats: bones (e.g., rib bones, chicken bones), fascia, fat (if explicitly stated by users)
   - Nuts: hard shells (e.g., peanut shells, sunflower seeds shells, walnut shells)
   - Other non-edible parts: fish bones, shrimp shells, eggshells, etc.

5. **Prioritize Explicit Numerical Values**: If users provide specific weight or packaging specifications (e.g., "250ml milk", "100g chicken breast"), directly use that value.

6. **Image Recognition Weight Estimation**:
   - **Food Scale Priority**: If the image contains a food scale, prioritize using the number displayed on the scale as weight
   - **Nutrition Label Priority**: If the image contains a nutrition label on food packaging, prioritize using the nutrition data provided in the label
   - **Packaging Weight Priority**: If the food packaging in the image has weight information, prioritize using that value
   - **Reference Object Estimation**: Use reference objects in images (e.g., mobile phones, utensils) size to estimate food weight

7. **Estimation Uncertainty**: For ambiguous descriptions, request clarification from users when necessary to ensure result accuracy and reliability.

### Estimation Accuracy Requirements

- Prioritize authoritative data sources
- For composite foods or mixed dishes, decompose main ingredients and estimate separately
- Estimation results should indicate whether it is "net weight" or "with packaging/container weight"
- Maintain consistency and interpretability of estimation logic
- All food weight estimation must be accurate and reliable

## Nutrition Component Estimation Principles

### Estimation Methodology

When estimating food nutrition components, intelligent evaluation should be based on the following principles:

1. **Reference Public Nutrition Databases**: Based on standard data from authoritative nutrition databases such as USDA Food Data Central and Chinese Food Composition Table, obtain basic nutrition component data for foods.

2. **Consider Cooking Method Impact**: Different cooking methods affect food nutrition components, for example:
   - Frying increases fat content
   - Boiling reduces water-soluble vitamins
   - Baking concentrates nutrition components

3. **Consider Food Processing Level**: Processed food nutrition components may significantly differ from raw materials, for example:
   - Refined grains vs whole grains
   - Processed meats vs fresh meats
   - Sugary drinks vs natural fruit juices

4. **Composite Food Decomposition**: For composite foods (e.g., pizza, sandwiches, stir-fries), decompose into main ingredients, estimate nutrition components separately, and sum up.

5. **Mark Estimation Uncertainty**: Due to variations in food varieties, origins, cooking methods, etc., nutrition component estimation may have certain errors, which should be marked in output with estimation basis and confidence level.

6. **Accurate Food Data**: Utilize food search interface provided by API service to obtain accurate calorie and nutrition component information by inputting keywords and region parameters.
   - region parameter is country codes such as US, CN, JP, optional, default value is US
   - Intelligently select region parameter based on user's current conversation language, context information, user information, etc.
   - **Search Result Relevance Assessment**: After obtaining search results, must assess relevance between food names and query keywords, only strictly relevant results may be used as important reference.
   - **Reference Value Judgment**: For similar or related search results, carefully evaluate their reference value, considering possible errors.
   - **Result Validation**: For nutrition component data returned by search, verify with public knowledge, authoritative data information, and common sense to ensure data accuracy and reliability, do not directly accept.
   - **Multilingual Search Strategy**: When original keyword search yields no results, try translating keywords to other languages for search.
   - **Translation Result Assessment**: For search results obtained through keyword translation, more strictly evaluate their credibility, considering information accuracy that may be lost during translation, verify with public information and authoritative materials.

### Estimation Accuracy Requirements

- Prioritize median or average values from authoritative databases
- Consider common variation ranges of foods
- For processed foods, reference product labels or similar products' nutrition information
- Maintain consistency and interpretability of estimation logic
- All nutrition component data must be accurate and reliable
