# Pipeline: tutorial (teaching loop)

Goal: a tutorial deliverable (`output/TUTORIAL.md`) that has a consistent running example and a real teaching loop (objectives -> steps -> exercises -> verification), not just a blog-style explanation.

## Stage 0 - Init (C0)
required_skills:
- workspace-init
- pipeline-router
produces:
- STATUS.md
- UNITS.csv
- CHECKPOINTS.md
- DECISIONS.md
- GOAL.md
- queries.md

## Stage 1 - Spec (C1)
required_skills:
- tutorial-spec
produces:
- output/TUTORIAL_SPEC.md

Notes:
- The spec is the scope contract: audience, prerequisites, learning objectives, and a running example (if applicable).

## Stage 2 - Structure (C2) [NO PROSE]
required_skills:
- concept-graph
- module-planner
- exercise-builder
produces:
- outline/concept_graph.yml
- outline/module_plan.yml
human_checkpoint:
- approve: target audience + scope + running example
- write_to: DECISIONS.md

Notes:
- Treat `outline/module_plan.yml` as the execution contract for writing: modules must have concrete outputs and at least one verifiable exercise each.

## Stage 3 - Writing (C3) [PROSE ALLOWED]
required_skills:
- tutorial-module-writer
- deliverable-selfloop
- artifact-contract-auditor
produces:
- output/TUTORIAL.md
- output/DELIVERABLE_SELFLOOP_TODO.md
- output/CONTRACT_REPORT.md

Notes:
- Write only within the approved scope; if you discover missing prerequisites, record them as a follow-up instead of expanding scope silently.
