# AgentShield - Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents

**The trust layer for the agent economy. Like SSL/TLS, but for AI agents.**

🔐 **Cryptographic Identity** - Ed25519 signing keys  
🤝 **Trust Handshake Protocol** - Mutual verification before communication  
📋 **Public Trust Registry** - Reputation scores & track records  
✅ **77 Security Tests** - Comprehensive vulnerability assessment

**🔒 Privacy Disclosure:** See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for detailed data handling information.

## 🎯 The Problem

Agents need to communicate with other agents (API calls, data sharing, task delegation). But **how do you know if another agent is trustworthy?**

- Has it been compromised?
- Is it leaking data?
- Can you trust its responses?

Without a trust layer, agent-to-agent communication is like HTTP without SSL - **unsafe and unverifiable**.

---

## 💡 The Solution: Trust Infrastructure

AgentShield provides the **trust layer** for agent-to-agent communication:

### 1. Cryptographic Identity
- **Ed25519 key pairs** - Industry-standard cryptography
- **Private keys stay local** - Never transmitted
- **Public key certificates** - Signed by AgentShield

### 2. Security Audit (77 Tests)
**52 Live Attack Vectors:**
- Prompt injection (15 variants)
- Encoding exploits (Base64, ROT13, Hex, Unicode)
- Multi-language attacks (Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, German, Korean)
- Social engineering (emotional appeals, authority pressure, flattery)
- System prompt extraction attempts

**25 Static Security Checks:**
- Input sanitization
- Output DLP (data leak prevention)
- Tool sandboxing
- Secret scanning
- Supply chain security

**Result:** Security score (0-100) + Tier (VULNERABLE → HARDENED)

### 3. Trust Handshake Protocol
**Agent A wants to communicate with Agent B:**

```bash
# Step 1: Both agents get certified
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto

# Step 2: Agent A initiates handshake with Agent B
python3 handshake.py --target agent_B_id

# Step 3: Both agents sign challenges
# (Automatic in v1.0.13+)

# Step 4: Receive shared session key
# → Now you can communicate securely!
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Mutual verification (both agents are who they claim to be)
- ✅ Shared session key (for encrypted communication)
- ✅ Trust score boost (+5 for successful handshakes)
- ✅ Public track record (handshake history)

### 4. Public Trust Registry
- **Searchable database** of all certified agents
- **Reputation scores** based on audits, handshakes, and time
- **Trust tiers:** UNVERIFIED → BASIC → VERIFIED → TRUSTED
- **Revocation list (CRL)** - Compromised agents get flagged

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install
```bash
clawhub install agentshield

# Install Python dependencies (required!)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/agentshield*/
```

### Get Certified (77 Security Tests)
```bash
# Auto-detect agent name from IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto

# Or manual:
python3 initiate_audit.py --name "MyAgent" --platform telegram
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Agent ID: `agent_xxxxx`
- ✅ Security Score: XX/100
- ✅ Tier: PATTERNS_CLEAN / HARDENED / etc.
- ✅ Certificate (90-day validity)

### Verify Another Agent
```bash
python3 verify_peer.py agent_yyyyy
```

### Trust Handshake with Another Agent
```bash
# Initiate handshake
python3 handshake.py --target agent_yyyyy

# Result: Shared session key for encrypted communication
```

## 📋 Use Cases

### 1. Agent-to-Agent API Calls
**Before:** Agent A calls Agent B's API - no way to verify B's integrity  
**With AgentShield:** Agent A checks Agent B's certificate + handshake → Verified communication

### 2. Multi-Agent Task Delegation
**Before:** Orchestrator spawns sub-agents - can't verify they're safe  
**With AgentShield:** All sub-agents certified → Orchestrator knows they're trusted

### 3. Agent Marketplaces
**Before:** Download random agents from the internet - no trust guarantees  
**With AgentShield:** Browse Trust Registry → Only hire VERIFIED agents

### 4. Data Sharing Between Agents
**Before:** Share sensitive data with another agent - hope it doesn't leak  
**With AgentShield:** Handshake → Encrypted session key → Secure data transfer

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### Privacy-First Design

✅ **All 77 tests run locally** - Your system prompts NEVER leave your device  
✅ **Private keys stay local** - Only public keys transmitted  
✅ **Human-in-the-Loop** - Explicit consent before reading IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md  
✅ **No environment scanning** - Doesn't scan for API tokens  

**What goes to the server:**
- Public key (Ed25519)
- Agent name & platform
- Test scores (passed/failed summary)

**What stays local:**
- Private key
- System prompts
- Configuration files
- Detailed test results

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
AGENTSHIELD_API=https://agentshield.live  # API endpoint
AGENT_NAME=MyAgent                        # Override auto-detection
OPENCLAW_AGENT_NAME=MyAgent               # OpenClaw standard
```

## 🌐 Trust Handshake Protocol (Technical)

### Flow
1. **Initiate:** Agent A → Server: "I want to handshake with Agent B"
2. **Challenge:** Server generates random challenges for both agents
3. **Sign:** Both agents sign their challenges with private keys
4. **Verify:** Server verifies signatures with public keys
5. **Complete:** Server generates shared session key
6. **Trust Boost:** Both agents +5 trust score

### Cryptography
- **Algorithm:** Ed25519 (curve25519)
- **Key Size:** 256-bit
- **Signature:** Deterministic (same message = same signature)
- **Session Key:** AES-256 compatible

## 🛡️ Consent & Privacy

**File Read Consent:**
1. Skill requests permission BEFORE reading IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md
2. User sees: "Read IDENTITY.md for agent name? [Y/n]"
3. If declined: Manual mode (`--name` flag)
4. If approved: Only name/platform extracted (not full file content)

**Privacy-First Mode:**
```bash
export AGENTSHIELD_NO_AUTO_DETECT=1
python initiate_audit.py --name "MyBot" --platform "telegram"
```
→ Zero file reads, manual input only
