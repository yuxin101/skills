# Changelog

## [2.1.8] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Replaced hardcoded log file path examples with portable placeholders in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## [2.1.6] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- Added prompt-injection boundary and aligned metadata/docs.


All notable changes to Smart Follow-up Suggestions will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **OpenClaw Native Auth:** Handler now uses OpenClaw-native authentication only
- **No External API Keys:** Removed provider configuration from openclaw metadata
- **CLI is Standalone:** The CLI tool is now a separate, standalone tool for testing — not part of the core skill functionality
- **Simplified Skill:** Core skill requires no configuration, works out of the box

### Removed
- Provider configuration options (`provider`, `apiKey`, `model`) from skill config
- Support for OpenRouter/Anthropic providers in the main handler (use CLI for those)

### Migration
If you were using external providers, the CLI still supports them for testing:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
node cli/followups-cli.js --model anthropic/claude-3-haiku --mode text
```

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- Removed hardcoded `DEFAULT_MODEL` from CLI (`cli/followups-cli.js`)
- CLI now requires explicit `--model` flag instead of defaulting to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
- Updated help text to clarify model parameter is required for standalone usage
- Aligns with OpenClaw-native pattern of using platform model defaults

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-04

- Privacy cleanup: removed hardcoded paths and personal info from docs

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-20

### 🎉 Initial Release

#### Added
- **CLI Tool** (`cli/followups-cli.js`)
  - Standalone command-line interface for generating follow-ups
  - Support for multiple output modes: JSON, Telegram, text, compact
  - Context parsing from various input formats
  - Integration with Claude Haiku API
  - Proper error handling and validation

- **OpenClaw Integration** (`handler.js`)
  - `/followups` command support

- **Documentation**
  - README.md: Feature overview and quick start
  - SKILL.md: Comprehensive OpenClaw integration guide
  - examples.md: Channel-specific output examples
  - INTERNAL.md: Architecture and design decisions
  - QUICKSTART.md: 5-minute setup guide

- **Features**
  - 3 contextual suggestions per generation (1 per category)
  - 3 categories: Quick (⚡), Deep Dive (🧠), Related (🔗)
  - Mobile-optimized UI (3 buttons = no scrolling on Telegram)
  - Context-aware analysis of last 1-3 exchanges
  - Sub-second latency with Claude Haiku
  - Cost-effective (~$0.0001 per generation)
