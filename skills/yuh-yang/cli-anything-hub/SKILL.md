# CLI-Hub Meta-Skill

CLI-Hub is a marketplace of agent-native command-line interfaces that make professional software accessible to AI agents.

## Live Catalog

**URL**: [`https://hkuds.github.io/CLI-Anything/SKILL.txt`](https://hkuds.github.io/CLI-Anything/SKILL.txt)

The catalog is auto-updated and provides:
- Full list of available CLIs organized by category
- One-line `pip install` commands for each tool
- Complete descriptions and usage patterns

**Note**: The file is served as `.txt` but contains markdown formatting for easy parsing.

## What Can You Do?

CLI-Hub covers a broad range of software and codebases, empowering agents to conduct complex workflows via CLI:

- **Creative workflows**: Image editing, 3D modeling, video production, audio processing, music notation
- **Productivity tools**: Office suites, knowledge management, live streaming
- **AI platforms**: Local LLMs, image generation, AI APIs, research assistants
- **Communication**: Video conferencing and collaboration
- **Development**: Diagramming, browser automation, network management
- **Content generation**: AI-powered document and media creation

Each CLI provides stateful operations, JSON output for agents, REPL mode, and integrates with real software backends.

## How to Use

1. **Read the catalog**: Fetch `https://hkuds.github.io/CLI-Anything/SKILL.txt` (markdown format)
2. **Find your tool**: Browse by category to discover the CLI you need
3. **Install**: Use the provided `pip install` command
4. **Execute**: All CLIs support `--json` flag for machine-readable output
