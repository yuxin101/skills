# Review Note Style Guide

## General Tone

- **Concise and direct** — No decorative language, no marketing-speak
- **Function-oriented** — Every sentence exists to help the user improve
- **Honest about errors** — Sugar-coating doesn't help learning; be blunt about what went wrong
- **Chinese as primary language** — English terms, vocabulary, and passage quotes preserved as-is

## Section-by-Section Guidelines

### Score Summary & Alert Box
- State the score factually: `得分：8/13 ｜ 用时：18:30`
- Break down by question type with ✅ / ❌ indicators
- The alert box should contain ONE sentence identifying the biggest scoring pattern (not a vague "需要加强练习")
- Bad example: "阅读理解能力有待提升" ← too vague
- Good example: "3道判断题全错，均为 NG 误判为 FALSE——没区分「没提到」和「相反」" ← specific and actionable

### Error Analysis Blocks
- Always include the **original passage quote** in a blockquote
- Keyword mapping uses `code` formatting: `题目词` = 原文同义词
- Error cause should reference the error taxonomy category
- Each block ends with a single-sentence lesson

### Synonym Table
- Only include synonyms relevant to the questions (not every synonym in the passage)
- Include the question number for cross-reference
- Chinese meaning should be concise (2-4 characters)

### Vocabulary Table
- Include phonetic transcription (IPA) after the word
- Part of speech before the definition
- IELTS frequency rating is mandatory (see 538 keywords guide)
- "Cambridge Appearance" column starts with current passage and accumulates over time
- Skip low-frequency specialist terms unless they caused an error

### Recurring Mistake Tracker
- Only include if the same error pattern has appeared in previous passages
- Format: List each occurrence with passage reference
- This section should grow across reviews — it's the most valuable long-term asset

## Naming Convention

`剑X-TestX-PassageX-TopicKeyword复盘.html`

Examples:
- `剑4-Test3-Passage1-街头青年信贷复盘.html`
- `剑5-Test2-Passage3-动物迁徙复盘.html`

## Formatting Rules

- Use the HTML template's CSS classes: `.correct`, `.wrong`, `.tag-yes`, `.tag-no`, `.tag-ng`, `.alert-box`
- Tables must use the template's styling (blue header, alternating row colors)
- Keep page-break-inside: avoid on blockquotes and table rows for clean PDF output
- No emoji overuse — limit to section headers (📌 ❌ 🔄 📝 💡)
