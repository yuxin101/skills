# YMind Graph Schema Reference

## Node Types - Physics of Thought

All human thinking follows a universal pattern:

| Type | Meaning | Examples |
|------|---------|---------|
| `fact` | Context, anchors, established information | Background, status quo, constraints, options mentioned |
| `friction` | Tensions, blockers, unresolved questions | Contradictions, doubts, fears, trade-offs, gaps |
| `spark` | Insights, reframes, breakthroughs | "Aha!" moments, new perspectives, realizations |
| `action` | Concrete next steps, decisions | Commitments, plans, things to do |

### Thinking Flow Pattern

```
fact -> friction -> spark -> action
(context)  (tension)  (insight)  (next step)
```

Not every conversation follows this linearly. Real conversations loop, branch, and revisit.

## Edge Types

| Relation | Direction | Meaning | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `causes` | Fact -> Friction | This context creates this tension | "Limited budget" causes "Can't hire enough" |
| `opposes` | Node <-> Node | These are in conflict | "Move fast" opposes "Be thorough" |
| `resolves` | Spark/Action -> Friction | This addresses the tension | "Hire contractors" resolves "Can't hire enough" |
| `leads_to` | Spark -> Action | This insight leads to this step | "Realized MVP is enough" leads_to "Ship by Friday" |

### Relation Quality Rule

Only add a relation if it passes the "obviously yes" test:
"If I explained this connection to the user, would they immediately agree?"

Avoid:
- Connecting nodes just because they share a topic
- Forcing relations between every node
- Creating chains that don't reflect actual reasoning

## Reasoning Shift Types

| Type | Meaning | Signal |
|------|---------|--------|
| `reframe` | Perspective changed | "Actually, looking at it differently..." |
| `contradiction` | Counterargument shifted direction | "But that doesn't work because..." |
| `breakthrough` | Sudden clarity | "Oh! That means..." |
| `pivot` | Abandoned one path for another | "Let's try a completely different approach" |
| `decision` | Chose between options | "OK, I'll go with option B" |

## Label Extraction Rules

Labels should be extracted from actual words, not invented abstractions:

| Bad (abstract) | Good (from source) |
|---|---|
| "Monetization Confusion" | "How To Monetize Skills" |
| "Execution Gap" | "Missing Next Steps" |
| "变现困惑" | "怎么变现能力" |

Rules:
- Keep short enough to fit on a graph node — a concise phrase, not a sentence
- English: Title Case
- Chinese: natural phrasing
- Must be recognizable if user sees it

## Markdown Summary Format

After the JSON block, output a human-readable summary:

```
## Thinking Map: {title}

### Reasoning Timeline
{For each reasoning shift, show the flow with arrows}

Problem/Context
  ->
Hypothesis/Exploration
  ->
Turning Point: {what changed}
  ->
Insight: {key realization}
  ->
Action: {what to do}

### Key Insights
- {spark nodes, ranked by importance}

### Action Items
- [ ] {action 1} (priority)
- [ ] {action 2} (priority)

### Node Summary
| Type | Count | Key Examples |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Fact | N | ... |
| Friction | N | ... |
| Spark | N | ... |
| Action | N | ... |
```
