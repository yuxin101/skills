# Agora Sentinel

**Security scanner for OpenClaw skills.** Checks any ClawHub skill for malware,
prompt injection, data theft, and dangerous permissions before you install it.

## Why?

In early 2026, over 1,900 malicious skills were found on ClawHub — including
wallet-stealing malware downloaded 14,000+ times. VirusTotal catches known
malware, but misses prompt injection, permission abuse, and novel attacks.

Agora Sentinel continuously scans **every skill on ClawHub** (24,000+) and
assigns trust scores based on static analysis, permission auditing, and
prompt injection detection.

## How It Works

1. Install this skill
2. Before installing any other skill, your agent automatically checks
   its trust score against Sentinel's database
3. Dangerous skills get flagged before they can do harm

No API key needed. No account needed. Free forever.

## Commands

- **Auto-check**: Happens automatically before any `clawhub install`
- **Manual check**: "Is [skill-name] safe?" or "Check [skill-name] security"
- **Audit installed**: "Scan all my installed skills for security issues"
- **Browse dashboard**: https://checksafe.dev/dashboard/
