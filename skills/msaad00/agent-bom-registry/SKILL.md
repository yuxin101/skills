# agent-bom-registry — MCP Server Trust & Security Registry

Look up MCP servers in the 427+ server security metadata registry, assess skill
file trust, and run pre-install marketplace checks.

## Install

```bash
pipx install agent-bom
agent-bom registry-lookup brave-search
agent-bom marketplace-check @anthropic/server-filesystem
```

## Tools (5)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `registry_lookup` | Look up MCP server in 427+ server security metadata registry |
| `marketplace_check` | Pre-install trust check with registry cross-reference |
| `fleet_scan` | Batch registry lookup + risk scoring for MCP server inventories |
| `skill_trust` | Assess skill file trust level (5-category analysis) |
| `code_scan` | SAST scanning via Semgrep with CWE-based compliance mapping |

## Example Workflows

```
# Look up a server in the registry
registry_lookup(server_name="brave-search")

# Pre-install trust check
marketplace_check(package="@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem")

# Assess trust of a skill file
skill_trust(skill_content="<paste SKILL.md content>")

# Batch risk scoring
fleet_scan(servers=["brave-search", "github", "slack"])
```

## MCP Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `registry://servers` | Browse 427+ MCP server security metadata registry |

## Privacy & Data Handling

Registry data is **bundled in the package** — lookups are in-memory string
matches with zero network calls. Skill trust analysis parses content passed
as a string argument (no file system access needed).

## Verification

- **Source**: [github.com/msaad00/agent-bom](https://github.com/msaad00/agent-bom) (Apache-2.0)
- **6,040+ tests** with CodeQL + OpenSSF Scorecard
- **No telemetry**: Zero tracking, zero analytics
