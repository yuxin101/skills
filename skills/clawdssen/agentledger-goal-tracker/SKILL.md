# Goal Tracker

Set goals that don't disappear. Get an agent that notices when you're drifting and says something.

**by The Agent Ledger** — [theagentledger.com](https://theagentledger.com)

## The Problem

Most goal systems fail the same way: you set goals in January, review them in December, and discover you drifted in February and never noticed. The solution isn't a better template — it's an agent that checks in weekly and flags drift before it compounds.

This skill turns your agent into an accountability partner. Not motivational-poster accountability. Honest, data-driven accountability.

---

## Setup

### Step 1 — Create Your Goals Directory

```bash
mkdir -p goals/
```

### Step 2 — Create Your Quarterly Goals File

Create `goals/GOALS.md`:

```markdown
# Goals

**Current Quarter:** Q[N] [YEAR]
**Quarter Dates:** [Start] → [End]
**Last Updated:** [date]

---

## 🎯 This Quarter's Goals

### Goal 1: [Name]

**Why it matters:** [One sentence — the real reason, not the polished reason]
**Success looks like:** [Specific, observable outcome]
**Deadline:** [date or end of quarter]
**Status:** 🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Off Track | ✅ Done | ⏸ Paused

**Key Results:**
- [ ] KR1: [measurable outcome] — current: [X] / target: [Y]
- [ ] KR2: [measurable outcome] — current: [X] / target: [Y]
- [ ] KR3: [measurable outcome] — current: [X] / target: [Y]

**Weekly Progress:**
| Week | Progress | Blocker | Score |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| Wk1  |          |         |       |

---

### Goal 2: [Name]
<!-- Repeat structure above -->

---

## 📋 Goal Backlog

Goals you want to pursue — not this quarter, but tracked so they don't get lost.

| Goal | Why | Estimated Quarter |
|------|-----|-------------------|
|      |     |                   |

---

## ✅ Completed Goals

| Goal | Quarter | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
|      |         |         |
```

### Step 3 — Tell the Agent Your Goals

Simply tell the agent your goals in natural language:

> "I want to hit $5k in monthly revenue by end of March. My key results are: launch the product by March 10, get 50 paying customers, and write 8 newsletter issues."

The agent will structure them into `goals/GOALS.md` using the format above.

---

## Weekly Check-In

Once per week (or when triggered), the agent runs a structured check-in:

### Trigger

Any of:
- "Weekly goal check-in"
- "How are my goals looking?"
- "Goal update" + progress description
- Automatic via heartbeat or cron (see Advanced Patterns)

### Check-In Protocol

The agent will:

1. **Read `goals/GOALS.md`** — load current quarter's goals and KRs
2. **Ask 3 targeted questions:**
   - What progress happened this week toward each goal?
   - Any new blockers or changed assumptions?
   - Do any goals need to be modified, paused, or killed?
3. **Update the weekly progress table** for each goal
4. **Recalculate progress scores** (see Scoring below)
5. **Flag any at-risk goals** with specific observations
6. **Output a Check-In Summary** (see format below)

### Check-In Summary Format

```markdown
## Weekly Check-In — [date]

### 📊 Goal Scores
| Goal | Last Week | This Week | Trend |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| [Goal 1] | [score]% | [score]% | ↑↓→ |
| [Goal 2] | [score]% | [score]% | ↑↓→ |

### ✅ Progress This Week
- [Goal 1]: [what happened]
- [Goal 2]: [what happened]

### ⚠️ Flags
- [Goal X is at risk because: specific observation]
- [KR Y has not moved in 2 weeks — is this still a priority?]

### 🔜 Commitments for Next Week
- [Specific action → [Goal]]
- [Specific action → [Goal]]

### 💭 Agent Observation
[One honest observation about goal trajectory this quarter]
```

---

## Progress Scoring

The agent scores each goal weekly using a simple formula:

**Goal Score = (KRs completed + KRs in progress × 0.5) / Total KRs × 100**

Example: 3 KRs total, 1 complete, 1 in progress, 1 not started → (1 + 0.5) / 3 × 100 = 50%

**Status thresholds:**

| Score | Status | Emoji |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 80–100% | On Track | 🟢 |
| 50–79% | Slight Risk | 🟡 |
| 20–49% | At Risk | 🔴 |
| 0–19% | Off Track | 💀 |

**Time-adjusted scoring:** The agent accounts for how far into the quarter you are. A 40% score in week 2 is fine; the same score in week 11 is a problem.

Formula: `Expected Progress = (Current Week / 13) × 100`
If `Goal Score < Expected Progress - 20%` → flag as At Risk regardless of threshold.

## Accountability Rules

These are the behaviors that make this skill useful instead of just a fancy spreadsheet.

### 1. The Drift Flag
If a goal's weekly progress entry is blank for 2+ consecutive weeks, the agent surfaces it: *"Goal X hasn't been updated in 2 weeks. Is this still active?"*

### 2. The Reality Check
When a KR target hasn't moved in 3 weeks, the agent asks: *"KR [name] is at [X]/[Y] and hasn't changed in 3 weeks. What's the plan?"*

### 3. The Mid-Quarter Warning
At week 6 (halfway through the quarter), the agent runs an automatic mid-quarter review and reports whether each goal is mathematically achievable given current pace.

### 4. The Kill Switch
If you tell the agent a goal is no longer relevant, it moves it to the backlog or archives it — but records the reason. "I killed this because [reason]" is valuable data for future goal-setting.

### 5. The Commitment Loop
At the end of every check-in, the agent asks for specific next-week commitments tied to each at-risk goal. These become the opening item for next week's check-in.

---

## Quarter Transition

At the end of each quarter (or when triggered):

1. **Score final results** — mark each KR complete/incomplete with final numbers
2. **Write a quarter retrospective** → `goals/retro-Q[N]-[YEAR].md`
3. **Move goals to Completed table** with outcome notes
4. **Archive the quarter** → `goals/archive/Q[N]-[YEAR]-GOALS.md`
5. **Open next quarter's GOALS.md** with blank structure

### Retrospective Format

```markdown
# Quarter Retrospective — Q[N] [YEAR]

**Overall Score:** [X]% ([N]/[N] goals completed or mostly completed)

## What Worked
- [specific thing]

## What Didn't
- [specific thing] — [honest reason]

## What I'd Do Differently
- [specific change]

## Carry-Over Goals
- [goal] → moving to Q[N+1] because [reason]

## Lessons for Next Quarter
- [lesson]
```

---

## Customization

### Set Your Quarter Dates
If your quarter doesn't follow Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct, tell the agent: *"My Q1 runs February through April."* It will adjust mid-quarter warnings and time-adjusted scoring accordingly.

### Adjust the Number of Goals
Default: 3–5 goals per quarter. Research suggests 3 is the sweet spot. If you want more, tell the agent — it will track them but may flag cognitive overload.

### Weekly vs. Bi-Weekly Check-Ins
If weekly feels like too much, tell the agent to default to bi-weekly check-ins. The drift detection threshold will adjust from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.

### Goal Categories
Optionally tag each goal with a category to track balance:
- `#revenue` — income-generating
- `#product` — building something
- `#audience` — growing reach
- `#learning` — skill development
- `#personal` — non-business

If all your goals are in one category, the agent will note the imbalance.

### Integration with Other Skills
This skill integrates cleanly with the rest of the Agent Ledger portfolio:

- **project-tracker**: Link goals to specific projects. When a project milestone completes, it can update the corresponding goal KR.
- **solopreneur-assistant**: The business dashboard can show goal scores alongside revenue metrics.
- **weekly-review** (via daily-briefing): Include goal status in morning briefings.
- **research-assistant**: When a goal requires research (e.g., entering a new market), spawn a research brief tied to that goal.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Goals feel vague | Break down to KRs with numbers. "Grow newsletter" → "Reach 500 subscribers by March 31" |
| Too many goals | Enforce the 3-goal limit. Ask: "If you could only accomplish one this quarter, which one?" |
| Goals feel stressful | Add a "Why it matters" sentence. Reconnecting to purpose helps more than adjusting targets |
| KRs keep changing | That's fine — log the change with a reason. Changing KRs = learning, not failure |
| Agent not flagging drift | Manually run: "Check my goals for drift and give me an honest assessment" |
| Quarter half-over, goals clearly won't happen | Don't hide it. Run the mid-quarter review early and reset targets based on reality |

## Advanced Patterns

See `references/advanced-patterns.md` for:
- Annual goals broken into quarterly milestones
- Multi-area goal tracking (business, health, relationships)
- Goal stacking (how goals support each other)
- Automated check-in via heartbeat/cron
- Public accountability (sharing goal scores in a newsletter or with an accountability partner)
- Post-mortem templates for missed goals
- Goal-to-project linking for tight integration with project-tracker
