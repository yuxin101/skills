# VyasaGraph — Persistent Agent Memory

**🇶🇦 Proudly built in Qatar 🇶🇦 — make ❤️ not 🚀**

Most AI agents are amnesiac by design — every conversation starts from zero. VyasaGraph changes that. It's an embedded knowledge graph that lets your agent remember people, decisions, and relationships, then find them later by *meaning* — not just keywords. No server to run, no infrastructure to maintain. Just drop it in and your agent goes from stateless to genuinely context-aware.

**Because memory is what separates a tool from a colleague.**

**VyasaGraph = No more Agentic Amnesia**

---

## 🧠 Dual-Layer Memory System

**What gives VyasaGraph superpowers?**

**1. SHORT TERM MEMORY** — RAM layer. Instant access to current-session context. Survives context compaction. Written before every response.
- Holds *hot, in-flight context*: what's happening right now, decisions made this session, things to remember before the next compaction
- Survives context window resets (compaction) because it's a file, not just tokens
- Think of it as a *write-ahead log* — the agent writes to it continuously so nothing is lost mid-session

**2. LONG TERM MEMORY** — Hard drive layer. Permanent knowledge graph with semantic search, graph relations, and project tracking. Persists across sessions.
- An *embedded SurrealDB database* (no server needed — it's a local file)
- Stores *permanent knowledge*: entities, relations between them, past decisions, errors, project state
- Query it with natural language and it finds all relevant memories — full native semantic search

VyasaGraph does this all automatically. No need to tell it to do anything memory-related.

## Why Two Layers?

| | SESSION-STATE | VyasaGraph |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | Instant (file read) | ~5–100ms |
| **Scope** | Current session | All sessions |
| **Purpose** | Hot context, write-ahead log | Permanent knowledge |
| **Survives compaction?** | ✅ Yes (plain file) | ✅ Yes |
| **Semantic search?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (HNSW vectors) |
| **Best for** | Pending tasks, decisions in flight | People, projects, history |

---

## Features

- **Multi-model database**: Graph + Document + Vector in one embedded engine
- **Semantic search**: HNSW-indexed 1536-dim embeddings (cosine similarity) — search by *meaning*, not just keywords
- **Graph relations**: Native SurrealDB graph edges with traversal (`works_at`, `reports_to`, `owns`, etc.)
- **Project management**: Built-in task board with status tracking (v3)
- **Error tracking**: Verrors system for recurring issue detection (v4)
- **Zero infrastructure**: Embedded RocksDB, no server needed — just a local file
- **MCP-compatible API**: Drop-in replacement for MCP memory operations
- **Node.js 18+**: ES Modules, works anywhere Node runs

---

## Setup

```bash
npm install vyasagraph
```

Copy the SESSION-STATE template to your workspace root:

```bash
cp node_modules/vyasagraph/SESSION-STATE-TEMPLATE.md SESSION-STATE.md
```

Set your OpenAI API key (for semantic embeddings — text search works without it):

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

---

## Wire into your agent

Add this to your **MEMORY.md** (or equivalent instruction file):

```markdown
## FIRST ACTION EVERY MESSAGE — MANDATORY
1. READ `SESSION-STATE.md` for hot context from current session
2. WRITE to SESSION-STATE.md BEFORE responding if user gives new decisions, deadlines, or context
   - Update "Last updated" timestamp on every write
   - Clear completed tasks from Pending Actions
3. SEARCH VyasaGraph: `const results = await vg.smartSearch('topic', 5);`
4. THEN respond with loaded context

## AUTO-RECORD — EVERY CONVERSATION
When the user shares substantive information, record it in that same reply:
- New facts about people → addObservations()
- Decisions or strategies → createEntities() + addObservations()
- New relationships → createRelations()
- Status changes → updateEntity()

Rule: If the user tells you something you didn't know before, write it to VyasaGraph
in that same reply. Do not wait for end of session.

## SESSION-STATE vs VyasaGraph
- SESSION-STATE = CPU cache (hot, ephemeral, write-ahead log, session scope)
- VyasaGraph = hard drive (permanent, semantic search, cross-session knowledge)
- Both required. Neither replaces the other.

## Key Paths
- VyasaGraph DB: `./memory.db`
- SESSION-STATE: `./SESSION-STATE.md`
```

Add this to your **SOUL.md**:

```markdown
## Memory System
I use a two-layer memory stack:
1. SESSION-STATE.md — working memory for the current session. I read this at the
   start of every message and update it before responding with anything important.
   This is how I remember what we were doing when context compresses.
2. VyasaGraph — long-term knowledge graph. Stores entities (people, projects,
   decisions) with relations and semantic vector search. I search this for context
   on every substantive message.

If the user tells me something I didn't know before, I write it to VyasaGraph
in that same reply. I do not defer to end-of-session.
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import * as vg from 'vyasagraph/src/index.js';

// Initialize (creates memory.db if it doesn't exist)
await vg.init('memory.db');

// Store knowledge
await vg.createEntities([{
  name: 'Alice (user)',
  entityType: 'Person',
  observations: ['Software engineer', 'Based in Berlin', 'Prefers concise answers']
}]);

// Create relationships
await vg.createRelations([{
  from: 'Alice (user)',
  to: 'Acme Corp',
  relationType: 'works_at'
}]);

// Add facts as you learn them
await vg.addObservations([{
  entityName: 'Alice (user)',
  contents: ['Leading the platform redesign project', 'Deadline: end of Q2']
}]);

// Semantic search — finds by meaning, not just keywords
const results = await vg.smartSearch('software engineering Berlin', 5);

// Always close
await vg.close();
```

---

## Search

```javascript
// ✅ Always use smartSearch — semantic + name boosting
const results = await vg.smartSearch('project management strategy', 10);

// Text fallback (no embeddings needed)
const found = await vg.searchText('Berlin engineer', 5);

// Open specific entities by name
const entities = await vg.openNodes(['Alice (user)', 'Bob (colleague)']);

// Full graph export
const { entities, relations } = await vg.readGraph();

// Stats
const stats = await vg.getStats();
// { entityCount: 42, relationCount: 18 }
```

---

## Project & Task Tracking (v3)

Built-in task board — track projects with status, priority, and next actions:

```javascript
await vg.createEntities([{
  name: 'P01 - Website redesign',
  entityType: 'Project',
  observations: ['Modernise the company website'],
  metadata: {
    status: 'Active',        // Not Started | Active | On Hold | Blocked | Complete
    priority: 'High',        // High | Medium | Low
    category: 'Work',        // Work | Personal
    nextAction: 'Finalise wireframes by Friday'
  }
}]);

// Update when done
await vg.updateEntity('P01 - Website redesign', {
  metadata: { status: 'Complete', completedAt: new Date().toISOString() }
});

// Get formatted markdown task board
const board = await vg.formatAsVtasks();
```

---

## Error Tracking (v4 verrors)

Log recurring errors as entities — build a pattern library over time:

```javascript
await vg.createVerror({
  subsystem: 'cron_daily_brief',
  errorType: 'timeout',
  errorMessage: 'Daily brief timed out after 30s',
  impact: 'User did not receive morning update'
});

// Check unresolved issues
const unresolved = await vg.getUnresolvedVerrors();

// Mark resolved
await vg.resolveVerror('ERR-123456 (cron timeout, 2025-01-15)', 'Increased timeout to 60s');
```

---

## Naming Conventions

Descriptive names = better semantic search:

```javascript
// Person: Name (aliases, role, relationship)
'Alice Johnson (Alice, Head of Engineering, reports to Bob)'

// Project: ID + name
'P01 - Website redesign'

// Document: Name (type, date)
'Q1 Strategy (board presentation, 2025-Q1)'
```

---

## Entity Types

Always set `entityType`:
- `Person` — individuals
- `Project` — tracked work (with metadata)
- `Document` — written artefacts
- `Analysis` — analytical outputs
- `Communication` — messages, threads
- `Error` — verrors (auto-managed)

---
