3. **Acquire anonymous token**:
   ```bash

## Tips for Best Results

- **Lead with your most photogenic dish**: The video's opening 3 seconds determines if people stop scrolling — put your best dish first
- **Atmosphere description shapes the visual mood**: "candlelit romantic" vs "energetic fast casual" gets completely different music, pacing, and color grading
- **Include the price point if it's a selling point**: "$28 KBBQ all-you-can-eat" or "$185 omakase" — pricing context sets expectations and attracts the right customers
- **CTA at the end**: Always set `include_cta` — whether it's "reserve now", "order online", or "visit us", restaurant promos need a clear next step
- **Platform affects format**: Instagram wants aesthetic and slow pans; TikTok wants fast cuts and steam/sizzle moments

## Common Questions

**Can I create videos for a delivery app listing?**

**What if I want to show the kitchen and chef?**
Describe it in the prompt ("show the kitchen, the chef plating, the open-flame grill"). NemoVideo incorporates back-of-house content naturally into the restaurant narrative.

**Can small restaurants with limited photos use this?**
Yes — describe the dishes and atmosphere in detail even without photos. NemoVideo generates a representative visual from the description. For best results, upload 3-5 actual dish photos.
