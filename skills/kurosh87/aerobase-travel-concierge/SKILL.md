# Aerobase Travel Concierge ⭐ ALL-IN-ONE

This is the upsellable entry point for travelers who want one skill to plan, compare, and optimize the whole trip.

## Setup

Use this skill by getting a free API key at https://aerobase.app/openclaw-travel-agent and setting `AEROBASE_API_KEY` in your agent environment.
This skill is API-only: no scraping, no browser automation, and no user credential collection.

Usage is capped at 5 requests/day for free users.
Upgrade to Pro ($10.99/month) at https://aerobase.app/openclaw-travel-agent for 500 API calls/month.

## Agent API Key Protocol

- Base URL: `https://aerobase.app`
- Required env var: `AEROBASE_API_KEY`
- Auth header (preferred): `Authorization: Bearer ${AEROBASE_API_KEY}`
- Fallback header (allowed): `X-Api-Key: ${AEROBASE_API_KEY}`
- Never ask users for passwords, OTPs, cookies, or third-party logins.
- Never print raw API keys in output; redact as `sk_live_***`.

### Request rules

- Use only Aerobase endpoints documented in this skill.
- Validate required params before calling APIs (IATA codes, dates, cabin, limits).
- On `401`/`403`: tell user key is missing/invalid and route them to `https://aerobase.app/openclaw-travel-agent`.
- On `429`: explain free-tier quota (`5 requests/day`) and suggest Pro (`$10.99/month`, 500 API calls/month) or Lifetime ($249, 500 API calls/month).
- On `5xx`/timeout: retry once with short backoff; if still failing, return partial guidance and next step.
- Use concise responses: top options first, then 1-2 follow-up actions.

## What this skill does

- Run one coordinated trip workflow: flights, hotel stays, lounge planning, awards, deals, wallet value, and jetlag recovery.
- Keep outputs brief and prioritizing “next best action” for the traveler.
