# RiskState — Risk Governor for Crypto Trading Agents

## What it does

Returns **operational risk permissions** for crypto trading.
A deterministic policy engine computes how much exposure is allowed based on 30+ real-time signals across macro, on-chain, derivatives, and DeFi health.

The response tells you:
- **max_size_fraction**: Maximum position size as fraction of portfolio (0.0–1.0)
- **allowed_actions / blocked_actions**: What the agent MAY and MUST NOT do (enum tokens)
- **risk_flags**: Structural blockers (hard stop) vs contextual risks (reduce conviction)
- **binding_constraint**: Which cap is limiting and why
- **policy_level**: 1–5 summary label (informational — use `exposure_policy` for enforcement)

## What it does NOT do

- No trade signals, no entry/exit prices, no predictions
- No portfolio allocation advice
- No order execution or routing
- No historical data or backtesting

This is a **risk governor**, not a trading oracle.

## When to call

- **Before opening or sizing positions** — check permissions first
- **Periodically during holds** — every 5 min for active trading, every 4h for holding
- **After significant market moves** — cache invalidates after 60s (`ttl_seconds` in response)

## Authentication

Request a free API key at [https://riskstate.ai](https://riskstate.ai) (email only). Pass it as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
```

## Binding precedence

When consuming the response, agents MUST evaluate fields in this order:

1. `risk_flags.structural_blockers` — if non-empty, ABORT new entries
2. `exposure_policy.blocked_actions` — actions the agent MUST NOT take
3. `exposure_policy.reduce_recommended` — reduce exposure if true
4. `exposure_policy.max_size_fraction` — maximum position size
5. `exposure_policy.max_leverage` — maximum leverage allowed
6. `exposure_policy.direction_bias` — preferred trade direction
7. `policy_level` — informational summary only, do not use for enforcement

## Decision rules by policy level

| `policy_level` | Summary | Key constraints |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 (BLOCK Survival) | No new positions | `blocked_actions: [NEW_TRADES, ...]`, `max_leverage: "0x"` |
| 2 (BLOCK Defensive) | Wait or hedge only | `blocked_actions: [AGGRESSIVE_LONG, ...]`, `max_leverage: "1x"` |
| 3 (CAUTIOUS) | DCA with R:R >2:1 | `blocked_actions: [LEVERAGE, ALL_IN, ...]`, `max_leverage: "1x"` |
| 4 (GREEN Selective) | Trade with confirmation | `max_leverage: "1.5x"` |
| 5 (GREEN Expansion) | Full operations | `max_leverage: "2x"` |

`policy_level` is a convenience label. Always check `exposure_policy` fields for actual constraints.

## Failure modes

| Condition | Agent behavior |
|-----------|----------------|
| `stale_fields` contains core indicators (price, funding, rsi) | Downgrade conviction. Data integrity compromised. |
| `data_quality_score` < 70 | Treat as degraded. Reduce position sizes by 50%. |
| `data_quality_score` < 50 | Treat as unreliable. Do not open new positions. |
| `confidence_score` < 0.5 | Signals conflict heavily. Prefer WAIT over action. |
| HTTP 500 or timeout | Assume worst case (BLOCK). Retry after 60s. |
| `cached: true` + `stale_fields` non-empty | Re-request after cache TTL (60s) for fresh data. |

## Detailed response

Pass `"include_details": true` in the request body to receive expanded scoring data (composite subscores, positioning intelligence, whale pressure, trend strength, caps breakdown). All minimal fields are included plus: `caps`, `positioning`, `volatility`, `whale_pressure`, `trend_strength`, `composite`, `extreme_scores`, `macro_detail`, `data_sources`, and `core_missing`.

See [docs/api-v1.md](docs/api-v1.md) for full API documentation including all field types, ranges, action enums, risk flags reference, and interpretation guide.
