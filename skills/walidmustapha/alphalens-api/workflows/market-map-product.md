# Product-Centric Market Map Workflow

This is the market map component of the Bottom-Up Market Intelligence Suite. Use this — not the Org-Level Market Map Workflow — whenever the user asks for a "bottom-up mapping" or "deep dive".

It produces **one market map per qualifying product** on a single tabbed HTML page. Each tab has its own competitor set driven by product-level similarity, not org-level similarity. This is what makes bottom-up mappings more precise — a company with 3 products competes in 3 different spaces, and org-level similarity blurs them into one.

**Always run Step 0 first.** A raw product array almost always contains delivery channels and feature clusters masquerading as products. Mapping them wastes effort and produces noise.

---

## Step 0 — Score and select real products (run before anything else)

Most companies in AlphaLens return 5–10 products. The majority are **delivery channels** (REST API, Chrome Extension, CRM Integrations, Bulk Data) or **feature clusters** (Proactive Sourcing as a sub-feature of a platform). These should never become their own market map.

**Scoring formula — apply to every product in the array:**

```
+40  is_primary_product: true
+10  per product_reference URL that is NOT the company homepage (dedicated solution/product page)
 +5  per distinct entry in product_target_audiences
  0  baseline

-50  product_name contains any of: api, rest, extension, bulk, integration, crm, webhook, export, sdk
-30  product_categories contains 'services' (not 'software')
-20  ALL product_references point only to the company homepage (no dedicated page)
-15  a key_feature of this product is also a key_feature of a higher-scoring product (subset signal)
```

**Decision rules:**
1. Compute score for every product
2. Keep only products with **score ≥ 20** (positive net signal)
3. Cap at **3 products maximum** — if more than 3 qualify, take the top 3 by score
4. **Pairwise distinctiveness check**: for any two qualifying products, ask — do they have >70% overlapping `product_target_audiences`? If yes, merge them into one map (they're the same product marketed twice)
5. **Job-to-be-done sanity check**: each surviving product should represent a different buyer action. If you can describe the remaining products as sequential stages of one workflow (e.g. Find → Receive → Enrich), that validates your selection

**Example — AlphaLens.ai (8 products → 3 maps):**

| Product | Score | Keep? |
|---|---|---|
| Proactive Sourcing | +55 | yes — primary, own solution page, 3 audiences |
| Inbound Deal Parsing | +55 | yes — primary, 2 solution pages, 2 audiences |
| Universal Enrichment Pipeline | +50 | yes — primary, own solution page, 3 audiences |
| Web Platform | +15 | no — below threshold; UI wrapper, homepage-only refs |
| CRM Integrations | -25 | no — "CRM" channel penalty |
| REST API v1 | -35 | no — "API/REST" channel penalty |
| Chrome Extension | -40 | no — "Extension" channel penalty |
| Bulk Data | -65 | no — "Bulk" + services category + homepage-only |

Result: **3 maps** — one per deal flow stage (Find → Receive → Enrich). The structural alignment to sequential workflow stages is the validation signal that the selection is correct.

**When NO products pass the threshold** (score ≥ 20): fall back to org-level similarity only and build a single map. The company likely hasn't been fully indexed at product level yet.

## Step 1 — Resolve the anchor company and fetch products

```bash
# 1a. Resolve the org
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/entities/organizations/by-domain/{domain}"
# → get organization_id

# 1b. Get all products for that org
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/entities/organizations/{organization_id}/products?limit=20"
# → returns list of { id, product_name, product_description, is_primary_product, ... }
```

Pick the **2–3 products** that are most commercially distinct. Good signals:
- Different buyer personas (`product_target_audiences`)
- Different pricing pages or product URLs
- `is_primary_product: true` always included
- Skip minor features or add-ons that aren't standalone products

---

## Step 2 — Full 4-ring parallel fan-out (ALL calls fired simultaneously)

Run all four signal sources in a **single parallel bash block** — never sequentially.

```bash
WORKDIR=$(mktemp -d)
API="https://api-production.alphalens.ai"
KEY="${ALPHALENS_API_KEY}"

# Ring 1: product-level similarity for each selected product
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/search/products/{pid1}/similar?limit=50&is_headquarters=true" > $WORKDIR/prod1.json &
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/search/products/{pid2}/similar?limit=50&is_headquarters=true" > $WORKDIR/prod2.json &
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/search/products/{pid3}/similar?limit=50&is_headquarters=true" > $WORKDIR/prod3.json &

# Ring 2: org-level similarity from anchor (offset 0 + offset 50)
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/search/organizations/{org_id}/similar?limit=50&offset=0&is_headquarters=true"  > $WORKDIR/org0.json &
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/search/organizations/{org_id}/similar?limit=50&offset=50&is_headquarters=true" > $WORKDIR/org50.json &

# Ring 3: domain lookups for known players (your own knowledge, 20-40 domains)
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/entities/organizations/by-domain/known1.com" > $WORKDIR/d1.json &
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/entities/organizations/by-domain/known2.com" > $WORKDIR/d2.json &
# ... all known domains in same block ...

# Ring 4: second-ring org similarity (top 5-8 orgs from Ring 2, run their similarity)
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/search/organizations/{ring2_top1_id}/similar?limit=50&is_headquarters=true" > $WORKDIR/r2_1.json &
curl -s -H "API-Key: $KEY" "$API/api/v1/search/organizations/{ring2_top2_id}/similar?limit=50&is_headquarters=true" > $WORKDIR/r2_2.json &

# Base64-encode each company favicon in the same block
curl -s "https://t0.gstatic.com/faviconV2?client=SOCIAL&type=FAVICON&fallback_opts=TYPE,SIZE,URL&url=http://{domain1}&size=128" | base64 -w0 > $WORKDIR/favicon_domain1.txt &
curl -s "https://t0.gstatic.com/faviconV2?client=SOCIAL&type=FAVICON&fallback_opts=TYPE,SIZE,URL&url=http://{domain2}&size=128" | base64 -w0 > $WORKDIR/favicon_domain2.txt &
# ... one curl | base64 per company in the same block ...

wait   # ← everything lands here
```

Only fetch favicons for public domains returned by AlphaLens — never for internal or private hostnames.

**The four rings and what each catches:**

| Ring | Method | What it uniquely surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Product similarity | `/search/products/{id}/similar` | Niche product lines inside large orgs; companies that org-level misses because their org description is too broad |
| 2 — Org similarity ring 1 | `/search/organizations/{id}/similar?limit=50&is_headquarters=true` | Direct org-level competitors; the obvious players |
| 3 — Known player sweep | `by-domain` for 20-40 domains you know | Established names that may be too large/small for similarity to surface (incumbents, emerging startups) |
| 4 — Org similarity ring 2 | `/search/organizations/{ring1_id}/similar?limit=50&is_headquarters=true` | Niche players only reachable by pivoting through a ring-1 result; almost never in ring 1 directly |

**Why product-level similarity is better than org-level for product maps:**
- Returns `product_name`, `organization_name`, `active_domain`, and cosine distance **in one call** — no second lookup needed
- Matches on product description + target audience embeddings, not just company-level embeddings
- Surfaces competitors that org-level similarity misses (niche product lines of large companies)

**Response shape** (all fields directly on each result item):
```json
{
  "product_name": "...",
  "organization_name": "...",
  "active_domain": "...",
  "organization_id": 123,
  "product_similar_cosine_distance": 0.041
}
```
Sort ascending by `product_similar_cosine_distance`. Skip result #0 (always self).

---

## Step 3 — Supplement with own knowledge (same as org-level workflow)

After the product similarity fan-out, add companies you know should be there. Check each via `by-domain`, mark pending/failed appropriately.

---

## Step 4 — Cluster per product, then build the tabbed HTML page

**Design rules:** Follow `workflows/market-map-org.md` Step 5 exactly for the base grid, cluster styling, anchor gold border, and PDF export settings. The following additions apply specifically to the tabbed product map:

- Build **one `<section class="map-section">` per product** inside a single HTML file
- Use **tab buttons** at the top to switch between maps
- Each tab gets its own colour palette (e.g. Ocean=blues, Air=ambers, Carbon=greens)
- Anchor company appears on **every** tab with gold border
- Map sections default to `display: none`; `.active` sets `display: block`
- PDF export **must collate all tabs** into a single PDF (one page per tab). Never export only the active tab. Temporarily show all `.map-section` divs, clone them into a container, export the container, then restore original state.

```js
// Tab switcher
document.querySelectorAll('.tab-btn').forEach(btn => {
  btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.querySelectorAll('.tab-btn').forEach(b => b.classList.remove('active'));
    document.querySelectorAll('.map-section').forEach(s => s.classList.remove('active'));
    btn.classList.add('active');
    document.getElementById(btn.dataset.target).classList.add('active');
  });
});
```

HTML structure:
```html
<nav class="product-tabs">
  <button class="tab-btn active" data-target="map-product1">Product 1</button>
  <button class="tab-btn" data-target="map-product2">Product 2</button>
  <button class="tab-btn" data-target="map-product3">Product 3</button>
</nav>
<section id="map-product1" class="map-section active">...</section>
<section id="map-product2" class="map-section">...</section>
<section id="map-product3" class="map-section">...</section>
```

Map sections default to `display: none`; `.active` sets `display: block`.

## Common pitfalls

- **Self appears first**: the anchor company's own product is always result #0 in similarity search — skip it
- **Low cosine distance = more similar** (it's a distance, not a score) — sort ascending, take lowest values
- **Product search `?description=...` query** (free text) performs poorly vs. product ID similarity — always prefer ID-based similarity after resolving the product
- **One company, multiple products**: a competitor may appear on multiple tabs if they have separate products for each space — that's correct, don't deduplicate across tabs
- **`GET /api/v1/entities/organizations/{id}/products`** only returns products for companies already indexed by AlphaLens — won't work for pending/indexing orgs
