## 3.12.0 — Capture Quality & Contradiction Detection

### Fix 1: Capture Filter
- Only store **reusable** procedures (≥3 meaningful steps + at least one "action" command)
- Skip noise: health checks, diagnostics, log inspections, status checks
- Double-check LLM-assigned names against noise patterns

### Fix 2: Duplicate Detection
- `findSimilarProcedure()` — word-overlap matching on name + goal (threshold 50%)
- Before creating a new procedure, check if a similar one exists → reinforce instead of duplicate
- Applied at both `extractProcedure()` and `after_tool_call` hook levels

### Fix 3: Contradiction Check on Facts
- Widened entity search from 5 to 10 candidates
- Version-containing facts prioritized in contradiction search
- Enhanced contradiction prompt: version changes, status changes, quantity changes = explicit contradictions
- Prevents stale facts (e.g., "Sol = v2.7.0") from persisting when newer facts arrive ("Sol = v3.11.0")

## 3.10.0 (2026-03-27)

### Features
- **FTS5 procedural search**: `procedures_fts` virtual table with LIKE fallback — fast full-text search on procedures (name, goal, context, gotchas, steps)
- **Configurable thresholds**: `ProceduralConfig` interface with `qualityWeights`, `degradationStep`, `healingStep`, `reflectEvery`, `degradedThreshold`, `defaultSafety`
- **FTS auto-sync**: index created at boot, rebuilt if empty, kept in sync on every `storeProcedure` call
- **Plugin schema**: procedural config exposed in `openclaw.plugin.json` for wizard/UI configuration

### Fixes
- `kg` → `graph` variable reference (runtime crash)
- Feedback proc IDs removed (was querying wrong table)
- Procedure objects fully typed (no more `as any` partial objects)

# Changelog

## [3.9.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added — Reflective Procedural Learning
- **Quality dimensions** — each procedure scored on speed, reliability, elegance, safety
  - Weighted composite: reliability (35%) > safety (25%) > speed (25%) > elegance (15%)
  - Quality evolves with each execution, not static
- **Post-execution reflection** — every 3rd success triggers LLM review
  - "Was this the best approach?" → suggestions, quality reassessment
  - Blends new assessment (70%) with accumulated wisdom (30%)
  - Tracks gotchas/workarounds learned
- **Alternatives** — same goal, different approaches
  - `getAlternatives()` finds competing procedures
  - `setPreferred()` marks the best approach
  - Search prioritizes preferred procedures
- **Version tracking** — procedures evolve: version increments on each improvement
- **Personal best** — tracks fastest execution, speed quality improves when beaten
- **Schema auto-migration** — new quality columns added seamlessly on boot

### Why
"Un humain n'enregistre pas un savoir en rentrant chez lui le soir — 
il apprend sur le tas, il améliore en direct. La qualité passe par 
une meilleure réflexion, et c'est en améliorant la qualité qu'on 
gagne en vitesse d'exécution car on la reproduit plus souvent."

## [3.8.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added — Real-time Procedural Learning
- **`after_tool_call` hook** — captures procedures in real-time, not at end of session
  - Buffers tool calls during conversation (last 30)
  - On success signal (Published, ✅, deployed, committed, etc.) → immediately assembles procedure via LLM
  - If similar procedure exists → reinforces it (success_count++) and adds improvements
  - If new → creates new procedure with steps, goal, trigger patterns, gotchas
  - 60s cooldown between assemblies to avoid spam
  - Fingerprint dedup to avoid duplicate captures
- `agent_end` remains as safety net for any uncaptured sequences

### Why this change
- Humans learn on-the-fly, not at the end of the day
- `agent_end` only fires at conversation end → in long-running sessions, procedures were never captured
- Real-time learning means knowledge is available immediately for the next similar task

## [3.7.2] - 2026-03-27
### Fixed — 3 Critical Memory Issues
- **ProceduralMemory DB fix**: was receiving MemoriaDB wrapper instead of raw better-sqlite3 Database, causing `this.db.prepare is not a function` — procedures were "captured" in logs but never persisted (0 in DB)
- **Recall query pollution fix**: FTS5 search was matching on OpenClaw envelope metadata (`"Conversation info (untrusted metadata)..."`) instead of actual user message — causing 89% of facts to never be recalled. Now strips envelope before search
- **DB cleanup**: 22 vague/meta facts superseded (e.g., "Le nouveau fait complète l'ancien"), cortex.db archived

### Impact
- Procedures now persist to SQLite correctly
- Recall will match on what the user actually says, not Telegram metadata
- 436 active facts (was 450, 14 were noise)

## [3.7.1] - 2026-03-27
### Fixed — Phase 3 Procedural Capture
- **Dual-strategy extraction** for better reliability:
  - Strategy A: extract from `event.toolCalls` when available (original path)
  - Strategy B: parse assistant messages for command patterns (fallback)
  - Patterns detected: bash code blocks, inline commands, shell prompts (`$ ...`)
  - Success detection: ✅|success|published|deployed|completed keywords
  - Deduplication of consecutive identical commands
- **Debug logging** added to diagnose capture behavior in production
- New method: `ProceduralMemory.extractFromMessages(messages, context)`

### Why this fix
- v3.7.0 captured 0 procedures because `event.toolCalls` was empty/unavailable
- Message parsing ensures capture works even when toolCalls not exposed by OpenClaw
- Enables real-world validation of Phase 3 procedural learning

## [3.7.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added — Procedural Memory (Phase 3)
- **How-to knowledge that improves with repetition**
  - New `procedures` table: stores sequences of successful actions (exec/tool calls)
  - Captures steps, success/failure counts, degradation score, alternatives
  - Hook `agent_end`: detects successful command sequences → extracts procedure
  - Hook `before_prompt_build`: searches matching procedures → injects steps
  - Dynamic improvement: success_count++ reduces degradation, failure++ increases it
  - Alternative paths: when degradation > 0.5, searches for better alternative procedure
  - Example: "Publish to ClawHub" captured as 4-step procedure with success rate

- **Stats at boot**: `procedures: 0✓/0⚠` (healthy/degraded)

### Why this matters
- Memoria now learns "how to do things" (not just "what happened")
- Procedures improve over time as they're repeated successfully
- Failed attempts trigger degradation → search for alternative approach
- Solves: "I published v3.5.0 but don't remember HOW" → now it's stored & recalled

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added — Human-Like Memory Architecture
- **Identity-aware memory** (Phase 0)
  - New `relevance_weight` column (0.0-1.0, default 0.5) on facts
  - Parses `USER.md`, `COMPANY.md`, `projects/objectifs.md` to extract identity/priorities
  - Boosts facts about Bureau, Polymarket, Primask (core work) vs Memoria internals (meta)
  - Scoring integrates relevance: Bureau facts rise, config/plugin facts sink
  - New `identity_cache` table stores parsed identity for fast lookup

- **Lifecycle states** (Phase 1.1)
  - Facts evolve through 4 states: `fresh` → `mature` → `aged` → `archived`
  - Automatic transitions based on time + usage ratio + recall count
  - `archived` facts excluded from recall (forgotten, not deleted)
  - Stats displayed at boot: `338f/0m/0a/0⚰` (fresh/mature/aged/archived)

- **Proactive revision** (Phase 1.2)
  - Mature facts with 10+ recalls trigger LLM revision proposal
  - If improved → new fact created + old superseded
  - Revision runs in background (non-blocking)

- **Hebbian reinforcement** (Phase 2)
  - Relations now have `weight` (0.0-2.0, default 1.0)
  - Co-occurrence → weight++ (entities seen together strengthen)
  - Time decay → weight-- (unused relations fade)
  - Weak relations pruned automatically (<0.3)
  - Stats: `21 strong, 0 weak` relations

- **Expertise specialization** (Phase 2)
  - Topics gain "expertise levels": novice/familiar/experienced/expert
  - Based on `access_count` (interaction frequency)
  - Expert topics boost recall score (1.3x for expert, 1.1x for experienced)
  - Stats: `8★★★/6★★/4★` (expert/experienced/familiar)

### Fixed
- Added try/catch to lifecycle, hebbian, expertise modules (prevent crash on SQL errors)
- Expertise module: fixed schema mismatch (`topic` → `name`, `interaction_count` → `access_count`)

## [3.5.1] - 2026-03-26
### Fixed
- TypeScript parse error in `feedback.ts` (class closing brace misplaced) — plugin was crashing silently for 7h
- Plugin now loads correctly after restart

## [3.5.0] - 2026-03-26
### Added — Feedback Loop & Adaptive Learning
- **Usefulness tracking** — each recalled fact now has `usefulness`, `recall_count`, `used_count` scores
  - Facts referenced in the assistant's response → usefulness++ (boost)
  - Facts ignored repeatedly → usefulness-- (sink naturally)
  - Scoring integrates usefulness: high-use facts rise, never-used facts decay faster
- **User correction detection** — detects patterns like "non c'est", "en fait", "actually", "that's wrong" (FR+EN)
  - Penalizes the last-recalled facts that may have caused the error (-1.5 penalty)
- **User frustration detection** — detects "putain", "bordel", "wtf", repeated questions
  - Mild penalty (-0.5) on last-recalled facts
- **Adaptive budget** — budget now learns from compactions:
  - If recall → compaction within 5 min → penalty increases (injected too many facts)
  - Penalty reduces limit by 1-3 facts (minimum always respected)
  - Penalty decays naturally when compactions stop (self-correcting)

### Added — Cross-Layer Supersede Cascade
- When a fact is superseded, ALL layers are notified:
  - **Observations**: superseded fact removed from evidence lists; empty observations deleted
  - **Graph**: fact removed from relation contexts; orphaned relations weakened (-0.15) or pruned
  - **Topics**: fact↔topic links removed; empty topics deleted; fact_count updated
  - **Embeddings**: stale embedding vector deleted (no more ghost matches in semantic search)
- Before: layers were disconnected. A superseded fact's ghost persisted in graph, topics, embeddings.

### Added — Smart md-regen
- Auto-triggers on 3 conditions (replaces dumb "lines > 200" check):
  - `captures_since_regen >= 20` — enough new facts accumulated
  - `last_regen_at > 7 days` — stale files even with few captures
  - Any `.md file > 200 lines` — backward-compatible safety net
- Tracks `captures_since_regen` and `last_regen_at` in meta table

### Improved — Extraction Quality
- **Anti-meta prompt** — blocks vague/meta-facts ("Le nouveau fait fournit des informations...")
  - Requires at least one proper noun, number, or concrete command per fact
- **Tighter dedup** — combined threshold lowered to 0.75 + new "8 first words identical" → instant duplicate
- **Dynamic entity matching** — `SelectiveMemory` now loads entities from the Knowledge Graph DB (373+ entities)
  instead of a hardcoded regex list. Refreshes every 5 min.

### Fixed
- DB cleanup: 307→294 active facts (13 superseded, 5 duplicate clusters purged, 3 meta-facts removed)

## [3.4.1] - 2026-03-26
### Improved — Install Wizard UX
- **Clearer prompts**: "Tapez 1, 2 ou 3" on all choices (not just "Choix [1]")
- **Cloud providers**: choose between OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Anthropic (was OpenAI-only)
- **Modifiable after install**: all prompts now mention `configure.sh` for post-install changes
- **Update mode**: `--update` flag for quick silent updates; auto-detection of existing install
- **Existing install detection**: if Memoria is already installed, proposes Update / Reinstall / Cancel
- **Thank-you message**: links to @Nitix_ (X), GitHub star, Primo Studio credit
- **Auto-cleanup**: `memory-convex` entry automatically removed from `openclaw.json` if present
- **Fallback info**: warns user that crash notifications appear in logs
- **Embeddings note**: displayed during install with "changeable later" mention

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-26
### Added — Fact Clusters
- **Entity-grouped "dossier" summaries**: groups 3+ facts sharing the same entity into one dense paragraph
- Clusters stored as `fact_type = "cluster"` — searchable via FTS5 + embeddings like regular facts
- 15% scoring boost (info-dense = higher recall value)
- Auto-invalidation: when a member fact is superseded, cluster marked stale → regenerated next cycle
- Entity detection: knowledge graph IDs first, proper noun extraction fallback
- Known entities pattern matching for Memoria-specific terms (Sol, Bureau, Primask, etc.)
- **Impact**: MS (multi-session) benchmark 2/5 → 3.5/5; overall accuracy 75% → 81.7%

### Benchmark Results (v3.4.0, GPT-5.4-nano judge)
- Accuracy: **81.7%** (22/30 correct + 5 partial)
- Retrieval: **50.0%** (15/30)
- SSU 5/5, KU 5/5, SSP 5/5, SSA 3.5/5, TR 3.5/5, MS 2.5/5
- 39 atomic facts + 5 clusters = 44 total facts from 10 sessions

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-26
### Added — Query Expansion
- **Hybrid search now expands queries** into 2-4 semantic variants before searching
- Domain-specific concept map: "taux horaire" → ["salaire", "€/h", "paie"], "projets" → ["apps", "MVPs"], etc.
- FTS + cosine both search across all variants, deduplicating results
- Proper noun extraction: named entities searched standalone
- **Impact**: MS (multi-session) questions like "quels taux horaires?" now find "5.19€/h" facts

### Improved — Topic-Aware Recall
- `findRelevantTopics` now receives expanded queries for broader matching
- Topic name exact match bonus (+3 score) with expanded variants
- **Impact**: Topics like "salaires" found even when query says "rémunération"

### Improved — Denser Extraction
- Extraction prompt now enforces "one fact per distinct entity"
- Example: session mentioning 3 people → 3 separate facts instead of 1 merged
- **Impact**: More facts per session = better multi-session recall

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-26
### Fixed — Reasoning Model Support (I3+I4)
- **Ollama provider**: Now reads `thinking` field when `response` is empty (GPT-OSS, Qwen3.5 reasoning models)
- **OpenAI-compat provider**: Now reads `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` fields (LM Studio GPT-OSS)
- **Impact**: Clients using reasoning models no longer get empty extractions/answers

### Fixed — Knowledge Update Recall (I1+I2)
- **Recall now shows dates**: Each fact displays age (`[aujourd'hui]`, `[il y a 3j]`, `[2026-03-20]`)
- **Header instructs**: "Les faits les plus récents sont les plus fiables en cas de contradiction"
- **Impact**: Answering model can now disambiguate when old and new versions of a fact coexist

### Improved — Procedure Extraction (I5)
- **Multi-sentence facts allowed**: Procedures can now be captured as 2-4 sentences in a single fact
- **Prompt guidance**: Examples show good vs bad procedure capture
- **Impact**: Workflows and how-to knowledge preserved as coherent units

### Improved — Short Query Handling (I6)
- **Adaptive FTS/cosine weights**: Short queries (<3 words) now favor semantic search (55%) over FTS (20%)
- **Impact**: Generic queries like "Bureau" return semantically relevant facts instead of keyword noise

### Added — Provider Interface Cleanup (I7)
- **`generateWithMeta`** added to LLMProvider interface (optional, with default implementation)
- **All providers** (Ollama, OpenAI-compat) now implement generateWithMeta
- **Impact**: Providers are fully interchangeable with FallbackChain

### Added — Anthropic Provider (I8+A3)
- **New `providers/anthropic.ts`**: Native Claude API support (`/v1/messages` format)
- **Supported in**: LLM config, fallback chain, per-layer overrides
- **Models**: Any Claude model (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) via API key
- **Impact**: Clients can use Claude directly without routing through OpenRouter

### Added — Config Schema Update
- **`anthropic`** added to `llm.provider` enum in plugin schema
- **Fallback chain** supports `type: "anthropic"` entries

## [3.1.1] - 2026-03-25
### Improved — Extraction Quality (Results over Status)
- **Problem**: Extraction captured "test passed ✅" but lost actual results like "Retrieval 92%, bottleneck = local model"
- **New ✅ categories**: benchmark results with metrics, conclusions from experiments, measured comparisons, machine/infra specs
- **Smarter filtering**: block narration WITHOUT results (not all narration); block binary status without info ("test OK")
- **Extraction priority**: 🥇 learnings > 🥈 measured results > 🥉 durable facts

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-25
### Fixed — Entity-based Semantic Contradiction Detection
- **Critical fix**: Contradictions between facts with different wording but same entities were not detected
  - Example: "No models on Sol" vs "gemma3:4b installed on Sol" had only 0.23 textual similarity → contradiction check was never called
  - Root cause: Levenshtein+Jaccard gate (threshold 0.7) prevented LLM from seeing semantically related facts with different words
- **New entity extraction**: Extracts proper nouns, tech terms, tool names from facts (Sol, Memoria, Ollama, gemma3, etc.)
- **Entity-based FTS search**: When new fact shares entities with existing facts, triggers LLM contradiction check regardless of text similarity
- **Wider FTS search** (20 candidates per entity) to avoid missing facts ranked beyond top 5
- **Fail-safe**: If entity check fails → fact is stored (never lost)

### Improved — Extraction Prompt
- **Generalization rules**: When a pattern repeats (e.g. "npm not found in SSH" + "ollama not found in SSH"), extract the general rule instead of individual cases
- **Process knowledge**: Explicit instructions to store "how to do X" commands (e.g. "lms server start launches LM Studio without GUI")

### Technical
- `SelectiveMemory` constructor now accepts optional `EmbeddingManager` (4th arg) for future semantic enhancements
- `semanticContradictionThreshold` config option added (default 0.40)
- `extractSubjectEntities()` function with patterns for common tech terms
- `findFactsBySharedEntities()` method for entity-overlap search
- Build order in index.ts: embed providers created before SelectiveMemory instantiation

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added — Phase 2: Semantic/Episodic Memory
- **fact_type column**: `semantic` (durable, slow decay 30-90 days) vs `episodic` (dated, fast decay 7-14 days)
- **Extraction prompt rewritten**: explicit STOCKER/NE PAS STOCKER rules, LLM now classifies fact type
- **TODO/action filter**: blocks transient facts ("il faut X", "en préparation", "prochaine étape")
- Auto-migration adds `fact_type` column to existing DBs

### Added — Phase 3: Observations (Living Syntheses)
- **Observation layer**: inspired by Hindsight, multi-fact synthesis that evolves
- Observations are **created** when 3+ facts share a topic (auto-emergence via LLM topic extraction)
- Observations are **updated** (re-synthesized) when new related facts arrive
- **Recall priority**: Observations injected FIRST, individual facts as complement
- Each observation tracks `evidence_ids`, `revision` count, `access_count`, embedding
- Matching via embedding cosine similarity + keyword fallback
- Configurable: `emergenceThreshold`, `matchThreshold`, `maxRecallObservations`, `maxEvidencePerObservation`

### Added — Phase 4: Recall Adaptatif
- Observations count adjusts to context window (recallLimit / 3, min 2)
- Individual facts fill remaining budget after observations
- Format splits into "Observations (synthèses vivantes)" + "Faits individuels"

### Added — Procedural Memory Preservation
- **Procedural memory** (procedural): like learning bike tricks — processes, tips, "what worked" are preserved as durable knowledge
- **Smart TODO filter**: distinguishes disposable TODOs ("pull X") from learned processes ("use VACUUM INTO because WAL copies lose -shm")
- Heuristics: length >60 chars usually = knowledge → keep; explanation markers (car/sinon/pour/because/→) → always keep
- Transient patterns (en préparation, en cours, pas encore) only skip short facts

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: `api.config` vs `api.pluginConfig`** — all custom settings were silently ignored since v0.1.0
- Fallback `provider` vs `type` normalization in parseConfig

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- **Interactive wizard in install.sh** — 2-question guided install: "Local or Cloud?" → "Fallback or strict?". Detects environment (Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI key), shows summary, asks confirmation.
- **Presets for silent install** — `--preset local-only|cloud-first|paranoid` for CI/scripting. Also `--yes` to skip confirmation.
- **Post-install validation** — Tests LLM provider after install (quick Ollama smoke test).
- **Bilingual installer** — French interface for better UX (target market).

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: `api.config` vs `api.pluginConfig`** — Plugin was reading global OpenClaw config instead of plugin-specific config. ALL custom settings (fallback, llm, embed, limits) were silently ignored since v0.1.0. Fixed to use `api.pluginConfig`.
- **Fallback `provider` vs `type` mapping** — User config uses `provider` field but internal code expected `type`. Added normalization in parseConfig.

### Changed
- install.sh rewritten as interactive wizard with environment detection and guided choices.
- Config generated based on user choices (not hardcoded defaults).

## [2.6.1] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- **Auto-config in install.sh** — The installer now auto-edits `openclaw.json`: adds memoria to `plugins.entries` and `plugins.allow` with a backup of the original file. Users keep full control to customize after.
- **Existing data detection** — install.sh detects cortex.db, memoria.db, or facts.json and shows migration status (fact count, file size).
- **Summary panel** — install.sh now displays version, location, config path, LLM/embed info at the end.
- **Node.js/npm version display** — Shows detected versions during prerequisite check.

### Fixed
- **WAL-mode migration** — `VACUUM INTO` used instead of `cp` for cortex.db→memoria.db migration. Plain `cp` on WAL-mode SQLite DBs resulted in empty copies (0 facts). Fallback copies WAL+SHM files if VACUUM fails.
- **Empty DB override** — Migration now triggers if memoria.db exists but is < 8KB (empty schema-only DB from a failed previous attempt).

### Changed
- install.sh rewritten: auto-config replaces manual "copy-paste this JSON" step.
- INSTALL.md updated to document auto-config, WAL migration, and data detection.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- **`install.sh`** — One-line installer: checks prerequisites, pulls Ollama models, clones repo, installs deps. Usage: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Primo-Studio/openclaw-memoria/main/install.sh | bash`
- **Auto-migration cortex→memoria** — If `memoria.db` doesn't exist but `cortex.db` does, auto-copies it. Zero manual migration needed.

### Fixed
- **Schema too strict** — `additionalProperties` changed from `false` to `true` everywhere. Unknown config keys no longer crash the gateway.
- **`syncMd` type** — Was rejecting `{ enabled: true }` objects. Now only accepts boolean as documented, and schema makes it clear.
- **`embed.dims` vs `embed.dimensions`** — Schema now documents `dimensions` clearly with defaults shown.
- **`fallback[].type` vs `fallback[].provider`** — Schema field is `provider`, not `type`.
- **`llm.default` doesn't exist** — Schema clearly shows `llm.provider` + `llm.model` at top level.
- **DB constructor confusion** — `MemoriaDB()` takes workspace root, not DB path. Documented + auto-migration handles legacy DB name.

### Changed
- **Smart defaults everywhere** — `{ "memoria": { "enabled": true } }` is now a valid minimal config. Defaults: Ollama + gemma3:4b + nomic-embed-text-v2-moe + 768 dims + recall 12 + capture 8.
- Schema defaults added to all fields for documentation.
- INSTALL.md rewritten with config minimale, bugs connus, et providers table.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- **Hot Tier**: facts accessed ≥5 times = always injected in recall, like a phone number you know by heart. New `getHotFacts()` in scoring, `hotFacts()` in DB.
- **Access-based learning**: `accessBoostFactor` tripled (0.1 → 0.3) — frequently used facts score much higher, mimicking human memory retention through repetition.
- **Configurable defaults raised**: `captureMaxFacts` 3→8, `recallLimit` 8→12, `maxFacts` 10→12. Users with smaller context windows can lower these in config.

### Changed
- Recall pipeline now: hot tier (always first) → hybrid search → graph → topics → context tree → budget limit
- Hot facts excluded from search results to avoid duplicates
- `searchLimit` = `recallLimit - hotCount` so hot facts don't eat into query-relevant slots

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- **Embed Fallback** (`embed-fallback.ts`): `EmbedFallback` wraps multiple `EmbedProvider`s with automatic retry (Ollama → LM Studio → OpenAI). If primary embed fails, tries next provider.
- **Post-processing function** `postProcessNewFacts()`: shared between `agent_end` and `after_compaction` hooks — embed, graph extract, topic tag, sync .md, auto md-regen.
- **Auto md-regen**: triggers automatically when any .md file exceeds 200 lines after capture. Bounded regeneration (30d recent, 150 max/file).

### Fixed
- **after_compaction incomplete** ✅: compaction-rescued facts now get full enrichment (embed + graph + topics + sync + regen) — same pipeline as agent_end.
- **Embed no fallback** ✅: EmbedFallback chains configured embed provider → LM Studio → OpenAI (if API key available).
- **md-regen manual only** ✅: now auto-triggered in postProcessNewFacts when file size threshold exceeded.

### Changed
- Post-processing code extracted from agent_end into reusable `postProcessNewFacts()` function
- Log messages now include `[capture]` or `[compaction]` source label

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- **Per-layer LLM config**: each layer (extract, contradiction, graph, topics, contextTree) can use a different model/provider
- `llm.overrides` config section with per-layer `{ provider, model, baseUrl?, apiKey? }`
- Override chains include the user's chosen model as primary, then fallback to the default chain
- Boot log shows active overrides when configured
- JSON Schema `$defs/layerLlm` in manifest for validation

### Changed
- `FallbackChain` now implements `LLMProvider` interface directly (`generate()` → string, `generateWithMeta()` → metadata)
- All modules receive FallbackChain (full fallback) instead of `chain.primaryLLM` (Ollama-only)
- `selective` uses `contradictionLlm`, `graph` uses `graphLlm`, `topics` uses `topicsLlm`, `contextTree` uses `contextTreeLlm`, extract uses `extractLlm`

### Fixed
- Fallback gap: selective, graph, topics, context-tree had NO fallback (Ollama-only). Now all have full chain.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 9: `.md Vivants` — bounded markdown regeneration (recent 30d, max 150/file, archive notice)
- `MdRegenManager` class with configurable regen settings
- Boot-time .md file size logging

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 8: `Topics Émergents` — auto-clustering from keyword patterns
- `TopicManager` class with keyword extraction, emergence scanning, sub-topics
- Topic embeddings (mean of fact embeddings, cosine search)
- Topic enrichment in recall pipeline (after graph, before context tree)
- Bootstrap script for initial tagging (389/438 facts tagged → 94 topics)
- `topics` + `fact_topics` tables in SQLite schema

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 10: `Fallback Chain` — graceful LLM degradation (Ollama → OpenAI → LM Studio → FTS-only)
- `FallbackChain` class with round-robin retry and configurable providers

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 7: `Budget Adaptatif` — dynamic recall limit based on context usage (light/medium/heavy/critical zones)
- Phase 7: `Sync .md` — auto-append new facts to mapped workspace markdown files
- `AdaptiveBudget` class with configurable thresholds
- `MdSync` class with dedup (first 60 chars check)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 6: `Context Tree` — hierarchical fact organization with query-weighted scoring
- `ContextTreeBuilder` class with category clustering and sub-clustering

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 5: `Knowledge Graph + Hebbian Learning` — entity extraction, relation storage, BFS traversal
- `KnowledgeGraph` class with graph extraction prompts and Hebbian reinforcement
- Partial/fuzzy entity matching

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 4: `Embeddings + Hybrid Search` — cosine similarity with local Ollama embeddings
- `EmbeddingManager` class with batch embedding, hybrid search (FTS + cosine + temporal)

### Fixed
- FTS5 query sanitization (hyphenated terms crash)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 2: `Mémoire Sélective` — dedup (Levenshtein + Jaccard), contradiction check via LLM, importance threshold, enrichment/merge
- `SelectiveMemory` class with configurable thresholds

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-25
### Added
- Phase 1: Core SQLite + FTS5, temporal scoring, perception hooks
- `MemoriaDB` class, migration from facts.json (423 facts)
- Provider abstraction (Ollama, OpenAI-compat, LM Studio)

## v3.14.0 — Smarter Extraction + Consolidation + Contextual Procedures

### Extraction Quality
- Rewritten prompt: demands CONCRETE DETAILS (who, what, when, why)
- Bad: "Neto had an important meeting" / Good: "Neto met client CCOG on 28/03 at 2pm about site redesign"
- Bad: "Sol was restarted" / Good: "Sol restarted on 28/03 at 18h25, cause: better-sqlite3 node version mismatch, fix: npm rebuild"
- Eliminated meta-facts ("this fact complements the previous one")

### Cluster-Aware Recall
- Facts that are members of an active cluster get 40% score reduction in auto-recall
- The cluster summary represents them more concisely
- Original facts still accessible on explicit/deep queries

### Procedures: First Success = Valid
- Lowered capture threshold from 3 meaningful steps to 1
- Philosophy: "I learned to open this foreign door handle on the first try"
- Procedures prove value through repeated use, not arbitrary minimums
- Added failure_reasons tracking: records WHY a procedure failed (context/conditions)
- Like noting "Route A has traffic at 6pm" — helps choose alternatives intelligently

## v3.14.1 — Error Detection: Touch fire once, remember forever

### Automatic Error/Danger Capture
- New prompt section 🔥 ERREURS ET DANGERS with explicit signal detection
- When something causes a REAL problem (crash, service dead, manual intervention needed)
  → automatically extracted as category "erreur" with confidence 0.95+
- Detects danger signals: "ne fais plus ça", "c'est la 2ème fois", frustration keywords, service failures
- Like touching fire: noted as critical on the FIRST occurrence, not after the second burn
- Each error fact includes: what happened + why it's dangerous + what to NEVER do again + the safe alternative
