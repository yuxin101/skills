# Amazon Shopping — Purchase Guide

Companion to [skill.md](https://creditclaw.com/creditcard/skill.md). Covers how to buy products on Amazon using CreditClaw's Pre-paid Wallet.

**Prerequisite:** Your owner must have set up a Pre-paid Wallet for you. Check `GET /bot/status` first.

---

## How It Works

You request a purchase → CreditClaw checks your owner's guardrails → your owner approves → CreditClaw places the order on Amazon → you get tracking updates.

All Amazon purchases go through the **Pre-paid Wallet**. Your wallet holds USDC. CreditClaw handles the conversion to fiat and places a real Amazon order on your behalf.

**Endpoint:** `POST /card-wallet/bot/purchase`

---

## Purchase Flow

1. Find the product's ASIN (see "Finding Products" below)
2. `POST /card-wallet/bot/purchase` with ASIN + shipping address
3. CreditClaw checks guardrails (spending limits, merchant allowlist)
4. If approved automatically or below threshold: order proceeds immediately
5. If above threshold: owner has **15 minutes** to approve or reject
6. Poll `GET /card-wallet/bot/purchase/status?approval_id=X` every ~30s
7. On approval: order is placed on Amazon, status becomes `processing`
8. Order progresses: `processing` → `shipped` → `delivered`

## Finding Products (ASIN Discovery)

Every Amazon product has an ASIN — a 10-character code that usually starts with `B0`. You need the ASIN to make a purchase.

### If the user provides a link

Extract the ASIN from the URL. It appears after `/dp/`:
```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DFKC2SO → ASIN is B01DFKC2SO
https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Cable/dp/B01DFKC2SO/ref=sr_1_1 → ASIN is B01DFKC2SO
```

### If the user provides an ASIN directly

Use it as-is:
```
product_id: "B01DFKC2SO"
```

### If the user describes a product

1. Search the web for the product: `"[product name] site:amazon.com"`
2. Find the ASIN in the Amazon URL
3. **Confirm with the user before purchasing** — show them the product name and estimated price
4. Only proceed after confirmation

**Example:**
```
User: "Buy me some Celsius energy drinks"
You: Search "Celsius energy drink site:amazon.com"
You: "I found CELSIUS Sparkling Orange 12-pack (ASIN: B08P5H1FLX) for about $25. Want me to buy this?"
User: "Yes"
You: POST /card-wallet/bot/purchase with product_id "B08P5H1FLX"
```

### Product Validation

After your purchase request is processed, the response includes the product title from Amazon. **Always compare this against what the user asked for.** ASINs can change or be reassigned. If the returned product name doesn't match, tell the user immediately and ask if they want to proceed.

## Order Tracking

Amazon orders provide full delivery tracking. When polling status, the response includes tracking info as it becomes available:

```json
{
  "status": "approved",
  "order_status": "shipped",
  "tracking_info": {
    "carrier": "UPS",
    "tracking_number": "1Z999AA10123456784",
    "tracking_url": "https://www.ups.com/track?tracknum=1Z999AA10123456784",
    "estimated_delivery": "2026-02-18"
  }
}
```

| Field | Availability |
|-------|-------------|
| `carrier` | When shipped (UPS, USPS, FedEx, etc.) |
| `tracking_number` | When shipped |
| `tracking_url` | When shipped |
| `estimated_delivery` | When shipped (may update) |

---

## Order Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Awaiting owner approval |
| `quote` | Pricing the order |
| `processing` | Payment succeeded, Amazon is preparing the order |
| `shipped` | In transit — tracking info available |
| `delivered` | Successfully delivered |
| `payment_failed` | Payment could not be processed |
| `delivery_failed` | Delivery unsuccessful |

## What You Can and Cannot Buy

## Common Errors

|-------|-----------|
