# x-twitter-browser

Execute browser actions on X using a saved login session, without the official X API.

Users log in once via a visible browser window. The session is saved and reused for all subsequent headless operations.

After installing into OpenClaw, the skill lives at:

```bash
~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/x-twitter-browser/
```

Commands below assume you run from the skill root directory:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/x-twitter-browser
```

## Use cases

- You want to automate X actions without the official API
- Running headless on a VM or Linux server
- Building a long-term extensible browser skill for X automation

## Architecture

This skill has two layers:

### 1. Session layer

Manages login and cookie persistence (stored in the centralised OpenClaw auth directory):

- `scripts/setup_session.py` — log in via visible browser, save cookies
- `~/.openclaw/auth/x-twitter/cookies.json` — Playwright storage state

### 2. Action layer

Performs actions using the saved session:

- Post tweet: `scripts/post_tweet.py`
- Reply to tweet: `scripts/reply_post.py`
- Repost (retweet) / Quote tweet: `scripts/repost_post.py`
- Like / Unlike tweet: `scripts/like_post.py`
- Bookmark / Remove bookmark: `scripts/bookmark_post.py`

## Dependencies

First-time setup (installs Playwright + Chromium):

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

**Note:** Chromium download is ~150MB and may take several minutes on first run.

**OpenClaw:** When running `setup.sh` via OpenClaw, it executes in the background and the user cannot see the `echo` output. Forward each progress message to the user so they know the setup is progressing.

## Session management

Session cookies are stored in `~/.openclaw/auth/x-twitter/cookies.json` (centralised auth directory shared by all OpenClaw skills, survives skill updates). Do not commit or share this file.

### Log in (first time or when session expires)

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_session.py
```

This opens a visible browser window with the X login page. Log in with your account (username, password, 2FA if needed). Once you see the home timeline, go back to the terminal and press Enter. Cookies are saved automatically.

### Verify session

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_session.py --verify-only
```

Success looks like:

```text
Session looks valid: https://x.com/home
```

If verification fails, re-run `setup_session.py` to log in again.

### OpenClaw / headless-only environments

If running on a headless VM, set up the session on a local machine first, then copy:

```bash
scp ~/.openclaw/auth/x-twitter/cookies.json user@server:~/.openclaw/auth/x-twitter/cookies.json
```

## Workflow

### 1. Set up session (once)

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_session.py
```

### 2. Post a tweet

```bash
python3 scripts/post_tweet.py \
  --text "hello"
```

### 3. Reply to a tweet

```bash
python3 scripts/reply_post.py \
  --tweet "https://x.com/username/status/123456789" \
  --text "My reply"
```

### 4. Repost (retweet) a tweet

Plain repost (no comment):

```bash
python3 scripts/repost_post.py \
  --tweet "https://x.com/username/status/123456789"
```

Quote tweet (repost with your comment):

```bash
python3 scripts/repost_post.py \
  --tweet "https://x.com/username/status/123456789" \
  --text "My comment"
```

For both reply and repost, `--tweet` accepts a full URL or just the tweet ID.

### 5. Like a tweet

```bash
python3 scripts/like_post.py \
  --tweet "https://x.com/username/status/123456789"
```

Unlike (remove like):

```bash
python3 scripts/like_post.py \
  --tweet "https://x.com/username/status/123456789" \
  --undo
```

### 6. Bookmark a tweet

```bash
python3 scripts/bookmark_post.py \
  --tweet "https://x.com/username/status/123456789"
```

Remove bookmark:

```bash
python3 scripts/bookmark_post.py \
  --tweet "https://x.com/username/status/123456789" \
  --undo
```

For like and bookmark, `--tweet` accepts a full URL or just the tweet ID.

## Rules

- `--verify-only` success means the session is likely usable
- If the page behaves oddly, buttons are disabled, or extra dialogs appear, re-run `setup_session.py`
- If Chromium fails to start, run `./scripts/setup.sh` to install browser deps

## Operational requirements

- Before the first action, check if session exists; if not, tell the user to run `setup_session.py`
- Run `--verify-only` before any write operation
- Confirm the action and content before executing
- Do not commit cookies to the repo (`~/.openclaw/auth/`)
- Call `scripts/*.py` directly

## Troubleshooting

### `No saved session. Run setup_session.py first to log in to X.`

No cookies found at `~/.openclaw/auth/x-twitter/cookies.json`. Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_session.py
```

### `Session is not authenticated`

- Session cookies expired (typically lasts days to weeks)
- Account triggered extra verification

Re-run `setup_session.py` to log in again.
